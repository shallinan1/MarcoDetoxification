"Our oils read;  President IS taking different tactics to deal with a corrupt malignant, hipoctitical , one way press!
Idiots forget what witnessed them doing during the last election process."
'Work together'? Dream on. The liberals are already busy creating the next scandal/crime to accuse President Trump of since they lose the policy debate every time. They are sniveling statist traitors and they should be ground into the dirt as they will never ever let up in their qwest to destroy this country by any means available. Of that you can be sure.
"Between racist Eastman and 'Slappy' Wilson the Wasilla delegation is an embarassment to the valley and the State. Both should resign. This is Trump's America, open racism in the Republican party and physical attacks on reporters.
Cue the usual racist adn commenters telling us how Eastman actually has a valid point with no evidence beyond an anecdote from the time they did a stint in the bush in 3...2...1...."
"Well here we go again.  Let's continue to subsidize the cost of power, costs that are out of control due to decisions made by the Liberal government.  How nice to know the government has such contempt for the citizens of Ontario that it thinks we won't understand we are being bribed with out own tax dollars - tax dollars we will have to pay back with interest - to make re-election of these corrupt fools possible.  Not enough that the deficit remains large, we will now increase that deficit to buy votes.  This stinks, just like the power plant cancellation last election.  Ontario voters, wake up and throw these bums out!!"
The profoundly stupid have spoken.
The ignorance and bigotry comes from your post!
"An ""abject lesson"" is a lesson that is painful or humiliating.  ""Object"" on the other hand is a noun--it is not even an adjective, it is not a descriptor of any kind per se.  It is entertaining though, to see a semi-literate boob getting advice from another semi-literate boob."
"Right on the money Gary Crum. And if they hide behind the anonymity of masks and the mob, they're cowards to boot."
"Hey Dallas, Don't let the Iditarod get the best of you.  Do the 2018 race.  Yes, the ITC is a bunch of malicious idiots.  But they will all retire/die soon, long before your career is even half over.  They can't charge you with anything because of the way the rules are for 2017 (the ITC has to prove intent, but they can't).  So get back to training your dogs, win the 2018 race ... and give the senile geezers of the ITC the finger."
I can't believe this country was so stupid.. -totally dumbstruck- you get what you get and don't throw a fit!
Somebody needs to dig up the Peterson's back yard!  What other evil deeds did Monster Mom hide to protect her killer sons?  Lock her up too.
"Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the ""Land of Milk and Honey""
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think."
"not a word about Germany criminalizing free speech on social media this week

WOW

State sponsored media and their thumbs down Globalist  lap dogs around here slopping up Merkel like she's a queen

She's destroyed Europe with immigration
Don't believe go there"
"""Just saw headlines on a couple of sites where Pres. Elect Trump is saying again that the election was rigged and that he would otherwise have also won the popular vote.""

I saw those stories as well. I've come across sore losers before, but Trump seems to be a sore winner."
"Who cares?  In all seriousness she, as with all Trudeau ministers , will be shuffled. Why? Simple, they're inexperienced in the field and well.... useless in every sense of the term. How can anyone think a lawyer would make a good environmental minster. In the end we the taxpayer have to deal with the mistakes of these incompetents."

"You know? I've been listening to your silliness for a couple of years. All of your buzz-words; ""beak dipping"" ""Kool-aid"" and I haven't heard anything of substance. When was the last time YOU made a decision that benefitted some people and had the possibility of harming others? When was the last time you actually did anything? Did you even go out and run this morning? Did you say ""Hi"" to your neighbor? Think not. You were up at 0100 waiting to spew venom. Suggestion: Try getting a real life."
Trump doesn't need no damn intelligence...he's already smart!  Said so himself.
"So what?  What if a guy from NJ hacked into the DNC email server and sent the emails to WikiLeaks?  What if the guy/gal was from Romania, Uruguay or Fiji?  It doesn't matter where the hacker came from.  What matters is that the DNC was dumb enough not to protect their data.  And if you are not smart enough to protect your data, it can get stolen.  And it's your problem, not a national security issue.  Geez,"
"Wait a minute, Hillary is the bon vide anticipated candidate of her party.  If she is unacceptable to so much of the American public, what does that say about the Democratic party?  Trump is the wildcard.  He shoots his mouth off.  He says what he thinks and refuses to kowtow to the sacred cows.  Guys like Gerson who are in the Establishment party, do not like Trump because he raises issues and asks questions the Establishment party does not want asked.  For example, Trump finds some equivalence between killing children with bombs and with chemical weapons.  The former is what we do.  The latter is what others do.  Both end up with dead children so why are the methods seen as so different.  For Trump to challenge the difference between the methods means we might be forced to reconsider killing babies with bombs.  The Establishment party would never like to be inconvenienced by having citizens question their bombing activities."
"Michael T,
Most people accept and ask for forgiveness without blaming  someone else for their wrong doing.
Don't you think it is so untruthful/cowardice of Catholic clergies and their aids always blame someone else for their sins or point to others wrong doing instead?
   
""Let us hope that a reorganized SNAP or some new org of another name emerges that will work for the good of victims and be helpful to the Church in addressing the problems. Must not be angry all the time.""
 
Sure what to be angry all the time for, it just the clergies raped children, ruins children's/their families' lives or children kill themselves! Every parent knows instantly what to do with the rapist! Why is it that CI clergy claim that they do not know what to do?  Is it really a sane person to pass the rapist around and around for thirty years to you?"
"Sounds more like the Antifascists are the real fascists...hey Antifa, have you suppressed opposing speech yet today? Attacked those you disagree with? Burned any buildings or cars?Those fools are so stupid they actually think they are espousing Americans traits...

Definition of fascism 1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition"
"Wow- new owners and already fresh, diverse opinions that are NOT from the Washington Post or New York Times!  I applaud Christine Flowers' unmasking of 3rd wave feminism and Leftist identity politics has made for itself-- largely fake campus ""rape culture,"" perpetuated largely by campus feminist groups.  After the 'Rolling Stone' falsifed its campus rape story, coupled with the numerous examples that Flowers brings up, society has slowly started to realize the harm this kind of faux victimhood thinking is doing to the next generation of youth. Yes, there are many examples of sexual assault- both from males and females- but to say ""rapists and perpetual rapists are everywhere, out there in the ether!""  Is not helpful to anyone, and this 3rd wave feminist thinking is toxic to everyone, including their own children:

"Dictionary definition:  Militia 1.(a) org., any military force...
Either you are too ignorant or stupid to read the first dictionary definition.  The only ""Well-regulated Militia"" legally existing in the U.S. is those under the Department of Defense.  Your definition only applies to those white supremacist private militia created by your fellow racists and bigots under Posse Comitatus idiocy roaming the nation to intimidate government employees and scared citizens.  The current examples sitting in jail in Oregon.  A ""Well-regulated Militia"" has been in existence for most of the history of the nation without any need for civilian weaponry to defend it.  The only need for civilian weapons is for hunting or protection; therefore all should be licensed and registered with full background checks before ownership like any other threat to other citizens in the wrong hands."
"""hadn't been out hunting it..."" he said!
but he was at a far enough distance away  that he couldn't identify it, so the first thing that entered his feeble mind was...
                          KILL IT!!!!
why was he carrying a rifle large enough to kill a buffalo? afraid of bear? they are asleep.
why did he shoot it from a distance that he couldn't tell what he was shooting at? why did he shoot at all? if he is so ignorant to do something like this, he probably would have taken a shot at a human being also."
Well its official  51 vs 49.  Yea!  Victory Victory is our cry!  Dumb republicans. Shame they didn't just support single pay health care.  Well maybe now they will.  lololol
"The real problem is lack of funds.  When logging was king we were the most generous state in the country. Now, we are sucking in our gut. BECAUSE the average homeowner is paying for everything., including illegal immigrants.  We need a sales tax badly.  Remember I've been a Duck since '76 and have always fought sales tax.  But the time has come to put some of the burden on people that buy things. (sounds like everybody, huh?)  Forget penny pinching."
"It's great that their community can preserve something important to them.  The one issue I'd take up with the author is with his repeated reference to lack of government support:
""Despite virtually no government support for our language""
""Governments have not considered our language worth supporting""
It's not the government's role to preserve someone's culture.  Silly assumption."
"More baloney.  WA Post reported emails of Manafort turning down efforts regarding Russia. AND, there is nothing wrong with any candidate having contact with a foreign leader.  Last, there is no way Putin himself would have been involved in any ""collusion"" directly.  Like saying Don Corleone was going to directly rub out someone."
Trump does do things that remind one of Hitler. He actually has a representative on each agency to monitor them like a hawk. If they do not follow his agenda completely he will know about it and deal with them accordingly. No president in the history of the United States has broadly put his fingers on each and every agency of the United States as Trump has. It is totalitarian and reeks of Hitler's controlling governance.
"Workaholic ... you mean the Pres who takes of every weekend and goes golfing. Lol - what a sick joke that is. So far his biggest job has been throwing rolls of paper towels at Puerto Ricans .

And when he's not on the golf course he spends most of his time on the porcelain throne tweeting out idiot comments."
"yep , always someone elses fault . Yet another hateful bully racist . Why dont you go crawl under a rock ?"

"And the ugly reality of CIA black ops being financed with drug money, the equally ugly ""coincidence"" of a new heroin epidemic and our ongoing involvement in Afghanistan---All hiding with the chickenhawks like the cowards they are; behind young men and women, many of whom actually want to serve our country...It's a shame in which both parties share the blame.  It's time for change."

"Unfortunately, Putin is far from stupid. Two stupid people working together might be safer - at least they could be controlled by their party handlers. One incredibly shrewd and absolutely unscrupulous actor (Putin was high up in the KGB, remember - those people weren't stupid) manipulating the other like a cheap marionette is a recipe for danger. It reminds me of nothing as much as the relationship between a certain German leader of the previous century and his unwitting Italian accomplice."
"He wanted to start a family in Syria but he's not Syrian. 

In other words he wanted to be a Islamist colonialist settler, establish an Islamic state or caliphate in Syria, steal land and property from Syrians and kick the Syrians out of their own country or else kill them.

The Syrian people did not invite these Islamist terrorist scum into their country.

Good thing this piece of garbage is history as far as I am concerned."

"Should Trump try to do any of those things, the Republican Party will find itself at a crossroads: join with the Democrats and impeach Trump — hoping that Pence can skate free by pretending to have known nothing — or continue to let the norms and laws of their 240-year-old republic be undermined by the seediest of con artists.

And there's no turning back if they take the wrong way."

"Gov Ige's veto message is a disheartening collection of lies and spin in service of a DLNR that has adamantly opposed and fought efforts to ban the trade in the past, which is why the bill proposed a moratorium on new permits in the first place. Ige turns that into a basis for a veto bcause it will ""take decades"" to implement, while, in the meantime, this (cruel, rapacious) industry might develop even more destructive means of harvesting the reef fish it sells on the world market! Just nonsense!!!"
"You know, honestly many are just loosing hope anymore. This hateful group of cowards are successfully destroying the United States. Look at how many likes he got for suggesting such a thing. They don't think about wether it's the right person, the right to a defense etc.. They are like a bunch of junk yard dogs. It's almost amusing how Trump manipulated them to gain power isn't it? These people have no thought process in regard to their condemnation. I guess the Middle East won after all because these idiots gave them their way. Divide and conquer is easily done with the stupid, manipulated and afraid. Trust this, that lot will be the first ones to bend over and give Hitler their guns when asked lol!"

"Trump is comically thin-skinned and the press is making him look stupid, so of course he's going to do whatever he can to sideline them, try to lift up those ""alternative"" news outlets that are friendly to him to take their place, and make up whatever positive spin he can to convince himself, and his followers, that he's on top of his game.

When it doesn't work he's going to get frustrated and bored, and then someone like Jared Kushner will be the functioning president, forwarded in the next election cycle as Trump's successor---And Trumpkins across the nation will fawn all over him, for whatever that'll be worth.  

Hopefully the economy won't be in a tailspin by then, but if it is, they'll have a newly minted democratic congress and senate to blame it on..."

"Paul- as Jenni astutely points out to you below--this asinine, wholly distracting bathroom measure is the work of Leftists pandering to a PC agenda and it is totally abhorrent that both politicians and the public have to waste both time and money responding to it.

I hope all you Far Left whiners don't go out and commit suicide based on the Comey hearing today.  Your leadership and the news media has led you over the cliff with their fictitious articles and speeches.  You need to go back to the election and not accept the false narrative that Clinton lost the election because of the Russians.  Clinton lost because she was a poor candidate under investigation by the FBI.  Get over it.

ACA was fully funded, and now, the GOP is purposely playing games and driving the price up.
OTOH, the Medicare Part D that was created by the GOP and voted in by the GOP, cost MORE than ACA, serves a small fraction of citizens, and was not funded for a single penny. It all comes from general revenue."

You sound jealous.  And you sound like a typical troll.
Bullshit.  If you are black the rules are different.

She will hear about a lack of accomplishment, bad decisions, the Clinton Foundation, the arrogance, the corruption.

Sick and tired of in state media members lecturing fans about how they are spoiled and ignorant. The national media is honest and think it’s OBVIOUS Helfrich should go. Comparing only wins and losses and not looking deeper is dishonest and shameless. I assert the local condescending Oregon media is trying to protect their own jobs and interests, and don’t actually care about keeping the Ducks great. Being gutless mouthpiece for Mark Helfrich makes people lose respect and not want to read your articles."

Great story.  Kudos to Samules and his friends for picking up trash- that was not their own.  One wonders if the Eider chick imprinted on the Gull.  Maybe.  Be interesting to see if the chick eventually tries to mate with Gulls due to the earlier imprinting.  That will be awkward.

(They even said America would be ""better"" if we changed to a ""brown"" country without explaining why). The level of self-hate and loathing with liberals is appalling."

Us hard working taxpayers continue to get raped financially by this liberal government!!! Sorry folks but every single person in this country has some form of injustice done to them - now does that mean that every injustice needs to be financially compensated?? I think the government might as well hand over $10 million cash to everybody to solve all the problems since they seem to think handouts solve the problems. This is really getting stupid!!!
"Comey, just another lying law enforcement official. And to think he actually was the top dog at th FBI."
My favorite is the piece done on two women that said Trump harassed them. The reporter made up a whole bunch of things that the women said they never did say. The NY Times is the slim of so called reporting. There are no respectful news outlets left in this country. They get a story and add all their own views and not telling the real stuff. The news these days is just a hunk of crap. Except when the Post says the Bronco's are gong down the toilet.

"""Imagine what the black market/dispensary weed contains?""

Yes, just what we need in this discussion: more of the imaginary. The imaginary has been haunting MJ since 1923 when it was outlawed in Parliament without debate; the imaginary is what led it to being added to the Narcotic Control Act of 1961, which had the dubious honour of placing cannabis on a controlled substances list with heroin, cocaine, and, ultimately, meth-amphetamines; and the police-imaginary helped fuel public beliefs in growers as gangsters (which I refute above).

And we'll have to go on imagining, since Federal policymakers at Health Canada and elsewhere have rigged things so that independent labs are not legally permitted to test dispensary MJ or they could lose their lab licences. So, thank you, once again HC for perpetuating ignorance and risking the health of CDNs! A level of hypocrisy not seen since Tony Clement left his post as Min. at HC."
"Junior is either an uneducated moron or a shameless pathological liar. Frankly I’ll argue it’s both. No matter how many times these shameless liars claim we hate Latino’s the issue remains; we hate illegal immigration and our laws not being enforced. As for this profound stupidity demonizing our corn, this staggering hypocrite has absolutely no problem with Mexico exporting cheap agriculture produce to America that created thousands of jobs in Mexico and South America. While Junior laughably claims we have killed thousands of corn growing jobs in Mexico, this clueless wonder says nothing of the tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs we exported to Mexico.
As for our unconstitutional illegal war on drugs, this has exposed naked just how corrupt the Mexican government is. Legalize all drugs and Mexico is still ran by criminals as they have ALWAYS been a corrupt country."

Exact opposite of what if happening in the States.  Trudeau is the new corrupt 'leader' on the block garnering favours from the elite be it China or super rich Muslim Imams.

Another economic meltdown similar to what we experienced under the prior republican president?  I also am against wholesale corruption which this president is now giving us.  

Sad thing is the Donald has no idea what his job is.  His desire to slash the budgets for the secretary of state and things such as NOAA are just stupid.  Just curious, will you enlist if he gives us another war?   But hay he sure sucks up federal money playing golf and traveling.  Way to go."

"Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump. 

She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.

 She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter. 

She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump."

"Sam Wallis.  If Trump were a Democrat (which he once was), the Democrats would be singing his praises--his success, his business acumen, his tough negotiating, his renegade methods to shake up a calcified system of government.  If GOP President Trump walked on water, they would criticize him for not swimming.  If he found the cure for cancer, they wold criticize him for ignoring Alzheimer's.  Democrats can't accept defeat, especially when they trusted the polls, ran a poor/corrupt candidate, and expected to be able to take credit for the first woman president along with the first Black president while continuing to play the race, gender, and all the other cards against the GOP.  That's what they can't get over, their own stupidly poor judgment.   Trump is struggling to find his way, but Americans who desire his failure aren't patriots.  They are the enemy within.  It's long past time for the Democrats to grow up and help Trump govern instead of inventing faux news and obstructing."
"So the US browbeats the Saudis and OPEC into cutting output to bolster prices, then stabs everyone in the back with increases from shale oil produced in the US?

"The well-known statistic is that ~3% of any given national population is homosexual.  Worldwide, clerical homosexuality is 2x to 3x higher at ~5-10% of a corps of 450,000+ priests with the Vatican well over ~50%.   

Just to show how the intrinsically disordered acts darken the intellect and harden the heart to create a slippery slope that leads to more destructive sins, ~90% of clerical pedophilia is committed by homosexuals compared to ~80% of general population pedophilia.

Satan has always targeted the Church that Jesus Christ built, going all the way back to Judas Iscariot.  The lust of the flesh appears to be Satan's most popular method of temptation for priests."

Of course the final section is about the housing bubble (boosted by Greenspan) that investment banks are still totally responsible for, and for which they have not been sufficiently punished.  Return of Glass-Steagall would bar investment banks from f**king over consumers, and would make consumer banking the dull business it should be.  No chance of that.

""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" 

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

I caught her by her diaper, teetering just at the top of the stairs.  I told her brother I saw him planning it, that I knew it was intentional, and gave him a couple of swats on the ass, over his clothes.

Of course there was a kerfuffle with my sister, but do I think I did the right thing? Absolutely. There's misbehaviour, and then there's malice, and that was malicious and could have killed her."

"LIberal Democrats are bunch of Liars, Deceivers, Haters, etc.. The ballgames over, the unity is over as Pelosi and others are already blaming the Right as to why their constituent went out and sought to Kill Republicans.
Democrats M.O. = never accept blame, it's someone else is at fault."
"Five police officers in Dallas were murdered by a (Black Lies Murder) supporter so it is true they are a radical racist terrorist group. In addition the Soros sponsored Antifai are just as disgusting as the White Nationalist, KKK and Neonazais 
As for you statement regarding BLM it was all started and based on the ""Hands Up Don't Shoot"" lie that was promoted by the Micheal Brown shooting."
"Chin is embarrassing himself, not Hawaii, although his folly may end up costing us hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Where did this guy get his law degree, anyway, and how can he be so ignorant of constitutional law?"
"Oh, quit sucking on mufflers and get a job."
"As I have said before, anyone who calls Pope Francis a Marxist is either a fool or a liar. Same for Obama or Hillary Clinton. Do any of you rightists have a clue about what Marxism is?

And anyone who calls for a missile strike clearly is no Christian."
When the terrorist this am stopped someone and asked if it was democrats or republicans playing on the field....then that's a terrorist.  I wish the media didn't just call a person a terrorist because of their religion.  How stupid is that?!
"motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention."
"No, Canada should not increase the number of Muslim immigrants, since the first batch is still struggling to support themselves. Or does the author  belive that Canadian taxpayers should just give up their standard of living to play charity? Muslim immigrants should be the responsibility of Muslim countries. Canada is NOT a muslim country."
... agree some neighbors are a waste of skin ...
"I want to separate out the nonsense of the Kathy Griffins and Ted Nugents of the world from stuff that really matters. Show business people are, for the most part, self-indulgent children, and the fact that technology gives them all kinds of platforms these days doesn't mean they are worth paying attention to.

But what elected officials say and do does matter. I'm not so naive as to believe there ever was a time in U.S. history when politicians were governed by either civility or honesty, but the wildcard today is the immediate impact their words can have, and rarely for good.

Trump's insomnia-driven tweets aren't harmless. One stupid comment from him at 4 a.m. can dominate the news cycle for the next 24 hours, putting Democrats into response mode and Republicans into damage control mode. And while all that's happening, the work of the country isn't getting done.

This president's lack of personal discipline exhausts Congress, the media and the nation. And that's not a good thing."
"Egypt used to be a majority Christian country. Now  a minority, Christians   are persecuted and  fleeing. History repeating itself in so many countries. 
Given the healthy demography of Muslim population, same will happen to countries such as France, (more than 10% Muslim), Great Britain (more Muslim than Christian babies born in Birmingham) or Germany.  It has already started: a non Muslim can no longer walk safely in some areas of France.  The police is scared to go there. 

In the meantime our dear Canadian leader continues focusing on ""Islamophobia' laws, and 'diversity is our strength' nonsense."
Don't forget serial rapist and liar Bill Clinton!!!
Not only he is a bad businessman but also a douchs that ruined the mural!! What an effing jerk!!

"And in embracing this unfortunate biographical detail, we are to believe that Our Lord spoke directly to St. Catherine, reached for the pitiful example of ""the Blind and the Stupid"" to make his point (yup, Our Lord spoke about his own children this way), said he became sick to his stomach at the mention of gay people (such delicate digestion) and concluded by noting that homosexuality is SOOO revolting that the formerly angelic nature of the devils themselves makes them skedaddle at the sight of two guys kissing. 

And if you believe all that . . . . well, my bank account could use a good sale right now."
"The eurocrat thugs of Brussels, are all the same. Wether they be running, the IOC, FIFA or the EU, they are nothing more than elite pigs at the tough. One generation away from Nazi appeasement, these truffle eaters will never change. Britain is far better off without them."

"IRT Thomas E. Stuart: Your hypocritical double standard is waving in the breeze.  Trump and his ilk (to use one of your favorite terms) questioned President Obama's legitimacy for eight years but now, despite mounting evidence that Trump owes his presidency to Russian interference in the election, you imply that all Americans owe him unquestioning loyalty, trust, and respect. That's a totalitarian expectation."
"Yes,Ivanka is the one to calm daddy down,make sure his sleeping meds are taken, and be there to pull his phone away  when he starts foolish twittering.  She needs to be the first one there before he starts ranting in a high level meeting.  She needs to be there for the ""3AM"" CRISIS CALL.  She is the only one trumpf trust in his created ""backstabbing"" world. HE TRUST NO ONE EXCEPT ONE FROM HIS LOINS.  He's a lonely Rich old man that even his 3rd wife is estranged from. SAD."
"It's really hard to understand the breathtaking incompetence of this entire administration.  Trump seems to have looked under every rock to find the absolute worst person available for almost every job.

Trump is veering toward impeachment or removal from office because of mental fitness.  He's obviously a psychotic."
"How to explain Trump's comments?  Trump is an imbecile.  That's how to explain it.

His administration has failed and will continue  to fail.  He's a worthless POS."
Can't fix stupid.
"Whats disrespectful is Bill's behavior.  He was a married man.  That makes him a cheater..  While acting POTUS, disgusting.  No way in HELL can a blow job in the Oral Office be neutered.  However show biz people are known for multi sex. opposite sec, homo sex, cheating sex and divorcing and getting married again.  NO ONE in show biz is expected to behave civily.  They are professional LIARS for their lifeschoice work.  How honorable is that?  And why shouldn't  Bill stay married to Hillary?  He knows he can cheat all he wants.  And Trumps marriage will remain in tact. Guaranteed.  You give me a time and a number, I'll take your bet.  And I don't gamble."

How sad that we have a dunce for a president. He always has a look like he messed his underoos or wants to. Keep the idiot home from the summit and send the White House custodian. At least we would have an adult representing our country and not an immature 71 year old just occupying a seat.

"This idiot that we have for BOC president recently hiked rates twice while the Canadian economy was stumbling into contraction.

This , at a time when Canadian household debt is at record high levels and Canadian household income levels under attack by the tax and waste Trudeau Govt.
Is it any wonder why our economic outlook is so uncertain.
Comsumers still form 70% of our economy, so a weak economic outlook is not surprising after that one-two punch in the gut .

What is also not surprising is the mismanagement of our economy by the Trudeau Liberals .

Can you imagine how awful they are when a $20 billion deficit elicits a contraction in GDP?

Surely, Canadians deserve better husbandy of their hard earned taxes"
"I filed the complaint, and it would be impressive to find an attorney stupid or ignorant enough to file a libel lawsuit based on the factual reporting of a public disclosure violation to the agency that is obligated to investigate exactly those types of violations.  The evidence was clearly provided.  The statute and WAC was clearly defined and the violation clearly explained.  Mr. Flygare may be able to explain away some of the violations, but they were violations nonetheless."

We need to reign in these arrogant lawyers, who become soft-headed judges.  Nobody elected them to make policy!"
My mistake. You and all the other lunatics in the asylum.
Nooo. Trump conspired with Kathy Griffin to post that video of his severed head.  The purpose was to give ISIS some recruiting material and to motivate them as they fight for their sorry lives.  Trump is not a Russian agent...He's a damn JIHADIST IN THE WHITEHOUSE!  OMG!

Don't be so insensitive.  Young kids in our community died.  The hell with rail.

"Yeah, Putrumpski has broken ""norms"" all right; like not being a traitor,not being disloyal to your country; not being a pathological liar, not being a sexual predator, not being a tax cheat, lying about your connections with an unfriendly, murderous, foreign ex-KGB dictator who launched a cyber-attack on your countries most important electoral process(and who knows what else) in order to ensure his pet candidate won the Presidential election. There lost more but that's enough to start.  The bigger issue are the similarly repugnant so-called American voters who not only willingly fell for every single lie, but continue to fall for them in the face of evidence exposing them as lies,  and to wilfully, knowingly, support the installation of a patently illegitimate, traitorous President-Elect in the White House."

"Well, the OP singled out one religion, and claimed that students wanted a mosque in school, which is complete nonsense.  

If the OP has an issue with the law, then it should only be changed when it is applied uniformly to all religions.  When Catholic schools are shut down and no one is allowed to pray or celebrate religious holidays in public schools, then the prayer room should also be eliminated.  Until then, it's quite hypocritical to say that Muslims shouldn't be allowed to pray for an hour a week when we have entire taxpayer funded schools dedicated to sects of Christianity."

Sadness is in order for the Trump Derangement Syndrome zombies that plague the land.  The liberal/radical snowflakes are in panic mode but they will have 16 years to grow old and probably die waiting for the Trump demise.
"Funny, how guilty until proven innocent is just dandy for conservatives until it comes to Trump.

Still don't understand?

Obama was elected twice.   Voters in the rust belt states voted for him, and this is how be was elected twice.

Obama is a Black American.   He was elected twice.

THOSE voters likely voted for Trump.  How do I know this?

Because Trump won the election.

But weren't those voters racists, bigots, basket of deplorable types?

Well, they voted for Obama, twice.  

Obama is Black.

Do you understand now?"
As he said it was not existence the ENTIRE time. Clearly is was in use in 2011 but not in the 50's or 60's. Good try being snotty but you sounded stupid.
Bruce Scotland - I like Trump just because it means idiots like you don't.
"Classic rap is one of the best things America has ever produced. Why shouldn't the Obama's have had the artists they like visit the White House? It's traditional for presidents to invite prominent artists to perform there. All this ignorant, and frankly racist, whining from commenters about rap is laughable. The cultural critique that inheres in classic rap music of the late 80's and 1990's is as relevant today as ever. Go to Europe (including eastern Europe) and hang out. Rap music, dj culture, reggae are all thriving and comprise the major cultural scene there.

When you make comments such as this, you're saying one of two things....
1) It is OK for Sessions to be a crook, but not Holder or Lynch, or
2) It is OK for Sessions to be a crook, since it was OK for Holder and Lynch...but you're only criticizing the latter.

Which version of hypocrisy do you prefer?

BTW--If HRC was/is such a crook, there's nothing stopping Session from going after her."

"This obsession and obstinate insistence on holding Trump to a 2015 promise that he changed in 2016 is just ludicrous.  

It is inane and ludicrous to obstinately insist that Trump did not nor can not change his mind on any of his Election2016 promise.

Inane and ludicrous because, get this, Trump promised to place Clinton in jail in Election 2016 when he becomes president."
another ignorant paranoid hillbilly.
He is not going to listen to any of that in fact he is  not going to listen at all. He will hold his hand  over  chest and tell everyone  what a good job he and  his band of fools are doing. I notice he does not have the balls to go to Alberta or Saskatchewan.

When nominated , his rallies had the audiences chant ""lock her up"", beat the crap out of protestors, additional language that usually requires bleeping, disparagement of immigrants and derogatory rants for an entire religion for the action of a few members, with no plans to actually run the Nation. 
His actual election reveals an underbelly of destructive values that has come to fore in the US. I am not sure scholastic measures would have aided us.

You are a troll. Live with that misery, or change your behavior to respect others, no matter whether you consider them better or worse than yourself. At the age of fifty, you still have time to change. Take that opportunity, because you will not be ""always there""."

Culturally, the question should be whether a Saudi, Sharia adhering female would forego head covering in order to not offend a Western culture while visiting.  If not, there can be no expectation of reciprocity.  Alternatively, if a woman in the American contingent CHOSE to wear a head covering, I don't think I'd have any sort of huge problem with that either.  The choice to show respect should likewise be respected.  What would be very, very impressive to me, is if the American men donned traditionally female Saudi head dresses and walked the mile in others' shoes.   That would take guts, and that would make an important point.  But I don't ""expect"" that.  Otherwise, let people wear what they want."

So you and your spouse come home and both plug in your 32 amp chargers to recharge the 100km you each drove that day. Then you want to cook dinner while your kids use the computers, watch TV, etc. Not to mention your HVAC (furnace, AC, HRV, etc) equipment loads. OOPS, not enough power. 

And remember that the morons in power in places like Vancouver and Ontario want you to not use gas to heat your home and hot water and switch to electrical for this energy also.

Further they ignore basic facts:
Fact:  Minoan, Egyptian, Roman and Medieval times were warmer than recently.
Fact:  In most studies CO2 follows temperature, not leads it (a cause cannot follow the effect)
Fact:  There has been no statistically-significant global warming since 1995.
Fact:  Solar cycles are a better fit to climate than CO2.
Fact:  The rate of the current warming is statistically indistinguishable from earlier warm periods.
Fact:  Glaciers retreated FASTER in the 1930s than recently

In fact, you thought it would have been a good idea if she had invited them to the White House for tea.  I'm curious, do you have the same expectations of Melania Trump? Is she responsible for her husband's infidelities and lewdness?  Should she have a sit-down with her husbands victims?  White House or Mar-a-Lago?"

My point is that the Church does NOT teach that sex is ""bad.""  It is those who hate the Church that report that the Church teaches that sex is bad.  So the reason that millenials don't got to Church is because some non-Church secular entity told them something that is not true.  Pathetic."

"I don`t know what your definition of loser comes from.  A Governor who sets this state on a robust and healthy fiscal path is no loser.  We were giving away the future solvency of the state by following the Senate plan of raiding the permanent fund and it`s dividends, and spending savings, and continuing oil subsidies, instead of doing their fiduciary duty for the state and people.
 I cringe at the thought of where we`d be if Parnell and his oily cronies in the House would have won.  We`d still be asking the cartel how much more they want in tax breaks and ""per-barrel"" subsidies to ""keep TAPS full"".  How long have they been selling that Exxon-POD-#23-like baloney?

I knew there would be some backlash on Chin who file the case. He said tourism will be affected by the ban. Well it also we be affected by the Boycott. Bet your foot is in your mouth now. Trump also made some heavy cuts to our budget. So now what? Maybe not as much tourists and no fed monies. As always our political leaders and people in authority open their mouths without really thinking things through. And to think we voted for these idiots. All smoke and mirrors. Better hope that things look up and I don't mean in a few years.
That ain't funny. The yobo is bona dude nuts

"Today was Trump's most disgraceful display of cowardice and incompetence yet. His failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis and his blaming ""many sides"" is intended to further empower these racist, anti-semitic hate groups. He built his campaign on hate, he staffed his White House with white supremacists and Nazis, so we should not be surprised these groups feel sanctioned to spew their racist hate freely."
That's the direction he received at his Russian Troll Farm today.
Hard lesson to learn for some fools. At least there was no innocent bystanders killed or injured.

"Your post exemplifies the mindset of the sort of person who should never be hired for any position of public responsibility.

The Republicans and the Democrats aren't different from one another in any substantive way. We should vote 3rd party or force the State to allow non-partisan elections at the state level. Otherwise, we're just going to swap one stupidity for another and kick the can down the road toward fixing anything."
"How many times does trump have to condemn  David Duke, the KKK, and White supremacist before you guys are happy?  10 times?  100 times?  1000 times?  Look, there is a lunatic fringe on the right and a lunatic fringe on the left.  That is all the Trump is saying.  There has been non-stop violence from the lunatic fringe on the left every since Trump was elected.  If you are being honest I'm sure you will agree.   There was a lunatic on the right who decided to drive his car into a crowd and kill someone.  Violence tends to happen when multiple hate groups from the lunatic fringe decide to show up to the same protest."
"motely crud, always looking for a fight, including butting into conversations just to trash talk nonsensical internet data you dig up for your twisted  pleasure. Using my minor children in a comment about Lewinsky/Clinton's oral sex in the WH is disgusting. Have you no decency?

Heh heh. Liberal heads are exploding all over. Most of the loudmouth know it alls are strangely silent today
"So Chroma if money is not speech then obviously nothing written is speech either right?  Nothing that takes time to produce is speech? Don't worry we see the hypocrisy in your statement because you want speech when you approve of it regardless of format but oppose speech when you don't like it.  Second if Corporations (the very name tells you what it is if you understood latin) are not people then said business entity could not exist, no contracts no liabilities no profits no stocks no retirement plans and NO TAXES for raising government revenue.  And of course every company would cease to exist if the owner died... Stupid is as stupid does with people making this argument. 

As for looking for politicians for sale to foreign interests both Clintons are guilty of doing so multiple times and the foundation could easily be charged with selling favors to foreign entities multiple times as well.  Democrats just love accusing others of doing what they do when no such thing is true."
"Just another case of our broken Criminal Justice system in Alaska!  

It used to be that a 'Felony' was a serious crime where the convicted was punished.  Not anymore, they are just put on probation and told to play nice and don't get caught again.  Which in this case, the Bethel complaint was a ""low-priority"" one and the result is a dead man and possibly his wife.

Yes, the Criminal Justice System is overloaded, understaffed and underfunded, we have heard that before.  Just like AST is understaffed and has to prioritize their resources based on ""priority"".  The big question is 'why'?

If the Legislature can remodel offices, buy buildings, take trips on state money, and make back room deals with boondoggles to nowhere, then perhaps their priorities are wrong?

When the Governor can take trips promoting business, spend obscene money on buddy attorneys and consultants while the people of the state deal with property crimes which are ""low-priority"",  perhaps the voters are just stupid!"
"Who cares if the fair weather fans turns thier back on the Nfl. More then Likely their team sucks anyway. The league will survive with or without those hypocrites.

"Trump makes a historic visit to Saudi Arabia and what does the FakeNews,.com cover? Melania's hair! Good job SA for publishing trash. Trashy paper, but appropriate for a Dem Party newsletter. Look at all the BoZos just eating it up like scavengers. It would be sad if it wasn't so funny."
"While Trump and his administration continue to declare that his response to the growing humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico is going well, it is becoming apparent that it is an abject failure.
After a week of Trump not even mentioning Puerto Rico, there has been another week where Trump has been just flat out lying about how everything was going great.
That's a lie.
But of course, Trump lies all the time, and about Puerto Rico it's more of the same, just lies.
Trump has been golfing, three trips this past week, 3 of the last 3 days and more golf tomorrow.
The abject failure appears to be a trifecta of Trump's utter incompetence, lack of urgency on the part of the Trump administation and the sheer magnitude of the damage. Many report that FEMA has ""collapsed"" on the island in terms of its ability to offer help and supplies to those most in need.
Trump says:
“We have done an incredible job.""
Sure, Donald, …if spreading cholera is doing an incredible job."
The Russia story is dead - any liberals who continue to push it will look even more foolish and idiotic than they already do.
"Will have to admit, the dog would be a better choice for President, than Trump, Clinton, Bernie.  The bark would carry some bite, which is what is missing."
The recent black president Obama was going to solve all of this. This man did NOTHING. He is a disgrace.
"Trump is a racist,
…and a petty con man,
…and a traitor.
But back to the racist part. 

That's what attracted so many of his supporters.

There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation,
…it's just a matter of time now.
Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong."
Trump just has a inept staff. It may be difficult to know what to say though when the boss Trump is incompetent. Sean Spicer is like Baghdad Bob. He can't keep his lies straight with the Presidents deliberate false statements. Trump is a below average President.
These scumbags need to rot in jail forever. I hope they toss them in general population butt naked with a huge jar of Vaseline. I'd like 10 minutes alone with each of the ass wipes to kick the crap out of them. Have in prison homies!!  Don't drop the soap.

What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers. Nice try though.

Disgusting race baiting comment.

"I'll ignore your silly straw man at the end, since that's not at all what I'm doing.  It's a common tactic some people use in discussions like this, pretending like it's ""defending"" when it's really pointing out hypocrisy.

England quickly forgave the US and has been a staunch ally of the US ever since.  You'll even find from statues of some of our founders there.  Plus, the southern states ARE still part of the US.  They're not some distant enemy where we have no concern for their people and their history.  Just because these states seceded for a few years doesn't mean we should pretend they aren't now and never were part of the US prior to that.  There's still a lot of Americans who consider that an important part of American history, and their family history as Americans."
"They should ban all video from determining rule infractions for professional golf.  Not everybody in the field is being video recorded so it creates an unbalanced competition.  Either a rules official on site, a competitor, or the golfer themselves should be the only people to call an infraction.  In addition, the infraction should be called BEFORE the player hits their next shot.  Stupid rules makes for a stupid game."
"Lee was in charge, he either knew, or was incompetent. Leaders always try to play ignorant when they are accused of war crimes, happens every time. Lee was defending the preservation and expansion of slavery, and multiple generals under his command captured free black americans and enslaved them. Thousands of free black americans were transported south during the campaign, and I will not buy for a second that Lee was innocent. 

I also care little that a handful of confederate soldiers might have released a few. They were a tiny minority in an army fighting for the sole purpose of preserving and expanding slavery. Once slavery because less fashionable the south started an enormous revisionist history campaign to paint themselves as victims or noble men defending their homeland. Total garbage."

It is people like you that stir up this hate and the will to kill.  Might I point out this is home grown like most of our internal terrorism including Timothy McVeigh and Dylan Roof - this has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with the escalating hate and division that you promote and excess access to guns designed for the sole purpose of killing as many people as fast as possible.  Want to see a maggot ?

Mulroney sold out our manufacturing sector and burdened us with GST.  The answer is simple, American oil has been against Canadian pipelines and funds groups like those protesting in Ottawa. It has nothing to do with not enough carbon tax. Protestors should be protesting the GST, the real problem facing ordinary folks. If the GST is so great, why doesn't the USA have one? Because it is grossly unfair. After tax income is ours, not theirs to poach. GST kills jobs here."

"Give me a break!!  Only now do these two women speak out.  They stayed silent, because they were willing to do anything to achieve fame and fortune in Hollywood. They had a choice and they made bad decisions.  If Reese Witherspoon was assaulted by a director, then why did she choose not to report it?  If Ms. Lawrence had to lose an unrealistic amount of weight over a short period of time, she chose to do so....but she obviously wanted that role so badly she was willing to endure their tactics to lose the weight.  These two women are hypocrites.  They did not HAVE to work in Hollywood, but more importantly, they stayed quiet while others were abused at the hands of these same people.   This type of abuse should never happen, but there's a reason they've used the term ""casting couch"" in Hollywood for as long as Hollywood has been in existence."

Pocklington has learned nothing in old age. Still believes that if you give all the money and all the breaks to the well heeled then everything will be good for all. The problem with that is that we now have almost 5 decades of stats that say that is total crap and that under their moral guides when wealth is created it goes to a very select few and the rest pick up scraps.

President Trump is a new power and has EVERY right to enforce the laws already in place but nobody ever enforced!!!! Illegals have raped and killed way to many Americans and been allowed to still stay here HELL NO!!!! They think just because they came here and had a kid that gives them the right to stay HELL NO !!!! They had pleanty of time to learn speak ENGLISH and to become citizens but choose not to so now they can ALL GO BACK WHERE THEY SNUCK IN HERE FROM !!!!!! They have No Rights to be here !!!! I STAND 100% WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

"Let's not be too hard on the alcoholic driver I'm pretty sure there were 4 idiots who chose to get in that vehicle with him and regardless of not having safety devices chose to be passengers with a drunk driver. 

Here's a thought make every single person accountable for their actions.  Can't make the deceased accountable so manslaughter for the driver for sure.  But why is it passengers always get a free pass when choosing to ride with a drunk driver?  They were behaving stupidly to get in a vehicle that didn't have seats or safety belts to begin with.  Not to mention the driver had been consuming and most likely he had been consuming WITH them.  My sympathy meter is used up. 

My condolences to the family of the deceased but aside from that, this is the price you pay for acting like your life doesn't matter when you choose to put it in harms way."

This comment here is so ridiculous and literally anyone who knows him could tell you that. These bullies have been targeting him for months because of his placement and they have frequently set him up to be blamed for things as a way to intimidate him. These kids targeted a kid with special needs and harrassed him relentlesly for weeks after months of more passive aggression. You calling the victim a bully is proof the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. Anyone with logic can tell you one kid with crippling anxiety is not bullying a group of popular edge lords. Good luck with that.

"Trump loves it when he attacks (more defection) others because the US can't get its act together. Someone else is always to blame. Never Trump of course.

Trump says this nonsense and then hears the cheers of his ""base"" in that country, and, worse yet, the Reform Haters in our own country. They love to trash Canada at every opportunity. Trump is their hero, as pathetic as that is.

Canada not only has an economic interest in its own food producers, but also a national security interest in producing our own food staples. Why do you think the USA, along with the EU, has the highest subsidies in the world for their own agriculture industry? Hint: not because they want to buy all their food staples from other countries!

But Trump comes-up with another BS argument, and the Reform Haters pile-on with the Canada attack. That is telling about why we should never have Reform Conservatives in power while Trump is there. A massive sell-out of our national interests would almost certainly ensue."

Due to liberal so called ""unbiased"" news agencies such as ADN and the failing Washington Post spewing so many one sided stories I can understand why he does not like the press. They are now reaping what they sowed, deal with it. They are now being punished for their actions and should be. I expect no less from PE Trump.

"Despite what some people posting on this thread would have us all believe, Swift's talent, wealth, privilege, like-ability or the lack of any of those things in irrelevant to the legal proceedings at hand. What is at issue is whether or not Swift or her team interfered with the DJ's employment. If the jury reasonably believes that the DJ grabbed her azz, then he looses and she wins.  If the jury doesn't think he grabbed her azz, but also doesn't believes that Swift didn't inter feared with his employment then they both lose.  For the DJ to win, the jury has to believe that he did nothing wrong and that Swift identified the wrong person, and then pressured the radio station to fire him. 

All the comments about Swift being untalented, a snake, spoiled, rich, privileged....blah blah blah... is just a bunch of spiteful garbage. (some people need to just grow up and learn some manners!)"

Likewise Notley two years ago had an approval rating over 50%, today it is in the low 30s while in Ontario Wynne was in the 40s two years ago while now in the teens.  In Newfoundland Dwight Ball was over 60% in early 2016, by the summer down to 20%.  One scandal, stupid mistake, or bad policy blunder can easily blow up one's high approval rating."

"In our parliamentary system we elect Members, not parties. Floor crossing is part of our system.

Let's compare your view and mine:

Here in Alberta, Jason Kenney is running for the PC leadership on a platform of collapsing 2 parties and moving everyone over to a merged conservative-not-centrist-like-the-PCs party. Details of his plan are sketchy at this point, but all versions of the Kenney plan require many Alberta MLAs to switch parties.

So Layla4, in your view should the entire Wild Rose and PC contingents in the Alberta Legislature stand down for by-elections when that happens??? Or would you argue that voters don't require consultation in that case? (and why not?)

BTW Jason Kenney used to be very vocal, expressing opinions similar to your own. Fortunately for Kenney, hypocrisy is part of his life condition."

First a disclaimer: my comments which follow are based on the validity of the claims in the lawsuitl   That said, some posters have commented that the City's alleged action was ""stupid.""  I think those folks are being too kind.  I consider it either ""very stupid"" or ""very, very stupid.""  One would think that somewhere in the group of individuals involved in the decision and action there would have been at least one person with the good judgment to say ""Hey, people, this is a really, really bad idea...we shouldn't be retaliating against this guy for exercising his constitutionally protected rights.""  

In my opinion, the City's only defense can be ""it didn't happen."" Otherwise, time to pay up.."

"I suspect it is primarily white liberals that have been surprised by the level of racism and bigotry Trump has managed to harness. Since I'm black, I get reminded daily of the racism in my fellow Americans. One of the more subtle effects of racism is the constant concern minorities must have for the emotional fragility of most of the white people here. If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became ""political correctness"" when us ""others"" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Cops routinely kill black people on the suspension of being armed. White men can attend political rallies while armed. We have never had equal protection under the law. I would pity the white people that are losers in globalization, if they didn't think killing black people would solve their problems."

Not an answer.  Fact is the Donald has barely been president and already his aministration is loaded with corruption.  He sure drained the swamp.  He actually made it 10 times bigger and filled it with slime.  Disgusting.  Hillary wasn't my choice but I think she would have handled the recent disasters a lot better.  Why are republican presidents so bad when it comes to helping disaster zones?  Its because republicans just hate their jobs.
"This is an important revelation that unmasks the rabid tribalism of contemporary politics.  
Two guys who are essentially the same, just wearing different shirts are rabidly hated by the supporters of the other side, and adored by their supporters - for the same damn reasons.  It all comes down to hyper-partisan tribal BS. ""He doesn't wear the same colour shirt as me, so he's scum!"" 

Hyper-partisanship is ruining what is left of our democracy, and is largely responsible for electing two completely unfit leaders in Trudeau and Trump."
"Nope.  SS tax is only paid on the first 118,500 in earnings, which isn't enough to spit at for the liberal elites.

Wrong again on the other taxes.  Normal people think that things like booze and lotto aren't necessities, but luxuries and thus should be taxed at higher rates.  Guess what?  Being rich is a luxury too, comrade.

If you don't want to pay the taxes, don't make the income.  But since overall taxes are regressive, we both know it doesn't work this way.

Tax the rich bastards!"
"Jane, but if a transgender has to use the bathroom - born a female, and now a male - that ""male"" has to use the womans bathroom if Minnery gets his way.  How, uh, uncomfortable do you think that will make your granddaughters?  They will be running out of the bathroom screaming ""bad touch bad touch"".   Yet, if the transgender who is a male, goes into the male bathroom, and uses a stall, no one will notice.  

so.... which do you want?  Or want your pastors to keep molesting kids, because that seems to be happening a lot more than transgenders converting your granddaughters to ""the geh""."
It seems like all of Hawaii with the exception of the Union's seemed to vote against RUSTY THE HATED SCREECHING RAIL . Toby must be smoking the local medical laced with dumb & dumber if he thinks extending the tax indefinitely is a good thing . As far as Caldwell's threats of using the property taxes to pay for RAIL CONSTRUCTON AND MAINTANANCE--- Not ging to happen &  I think even those in he Union's would agree.  The reality is Caldwell must go and the sooner the better. We should either Impeach/fire or just plan throw tomatoes at him every time we see him tell he resigns. Just the thought of a rotten tomato smacking his forehead makes me feel good How about you!!!!!!!
"These are not ""assault rifles"".  Assault rifles are automatic, not semi-automatic.  This guy is showing his ignorance and leftist ""university"" ideology.  If the good Doctor actually said such nonsense, his name should be withdrawn immediately. There is nothing logical or ""common sense"" about restricting the rights of law abiding citizens who are qualified under the law from obtaining or using ""semi-automatic"" weapons.  They have been available for about 60 years and are useful for hunting and self defense.  If they were banned, only law abiding citizens would be stripped from their God given right of self defense against criminals and terrorists, who don't give a rat's as_ about laws.  Duh!

If people can make up their own minds about what is good and what is evil, what is the point of Christ and His Church; what is the point of this bishop and those like him?"

"Bet ya it's a scam by a government official staging a fight with phony witnesses. Want to make him leave Bali so they can steal his business. Indonesia and moslems full of shite. Happens in Mexico, Thailand, Philippines, Africa, Russia, and everywhere. Now airport security in collaboration with baggage boys and customs checkers can open your bags in your absence and still anything they like because they know you won't notice your things gone until after you unpack at home. They have copied of the TSA keys. Some even plant bullets in your luggage like the Philippines and other in airports and hotels will plant drugs to get a piece of the fine. If you travel leave your wedding rings and jewelry home. No need new fancy clothes where T-shirts and old shorts are fine. Just take things you don't care if they're lost. No buy anything.

My kids want to live another 20 years in Vancouver. I don't see that happening. There are a lot of people   that are totally hurt by this. Several class mates of my children had to move - because they are poor.  Its going to be a red hot summer of protests. l have heard lots of people on the bus say politicians are corrupt - One person said lock them up or bury them permanently in poop - (meaning lets get rid of them) Voting them out is better than killing them - but a lot of people disagree.  l would not be surprised if a politician  dies from this frustration people feel. l expect the politicians will commit suicide because of the large amount of corruption in BC politics - scared of going to Jail where they will be a bum boy on the range.

Eugene police are already seriously understaffed, the Sheriff's department is worse.

I may be misinterpreting just what is being suggested.  But if I want an effective 'justice' system for my visiting college students, I would want to have the patrol, the arrest, the court and punishment be the same system.     There is no way local police/courts can do this without great cost, let alone the level of resistance most colleges would give to making their campus a police state.   

Another resistance would be parents.  Even at Central College in tiny Pella, we had parents providing quick bail and lawyering up to protect their babies that re just being 'college kids'.   (most offenses were public drinking off campus and property destruction by stupid drunk students)

This may come down to off campus, versus on campus offenses?"

Monday: Damaged victims are turned into greedy claimants, transparent church motions to seal church files that reveal the ugly truth, Hide behind religious freedom while using callous legal strategies to sidestep accountability,  Begrudgingly offer to compensate victims who still are alive, pennies on the dollar for shattered childhoods and families, lifelong pain and depression, spiritual confusion, inability to trust in anyone and anything.

"Kristin,
After reading your answers to the Herald Q&A, I still may vote for you, but feel the need to point out that you have your facts wrong about Lord Hill.  There are many studies that show the effect of mountain biking on wilderness is lower than the impact of equestrian use.  Simple reasons are 1- they are a thousand pounds lighter; 2- rolling impact is less than stepping; 3- bikers don't graze; and 4- bikes don't leave urine and poop on the trails.

Main reasons for mountain bike damage are unauthorized trails, so if you allow them to build in designated zones, there should be no need for additional trail building; and skidding, which again is mitigated by proper trail design.

Lord Hill is large enough to share, you can have your peaceful walks and we can bike 500 feet away, and you'll never know we are there or step in our shit."

 A simple 'Thank You' would suffice instead of your Socialist drivel that everybody owes you a free ride.

"While Trump continues to rightfully condemn the violence from both sides, the Dems/Media continue to ignore the radical left's violent Antifa anarchist groups, pretending they are insignificant.

I applaud the President for his consistency, something the hypocritical Dems/Media are sorely lacking."

You are obviously a public sector gravy train worker or bureaucrats. 
Positive attitudes don't feed the poor my friend
Jobs do. Veteran supports that are due to them.

They did not want to live outside you jerk"
"Really? Having a penis automatically makes you a man? Nope. Just as planting a seed in a woman's womb and producing a baby doesn't automatically you a father, simply having a penis doesn't automatically make you a man: Both designations have to be earned, something you'd know if you were a real man."
"Trademarks are an asset to a business, and businesses protect their assets. It's not a matter of believing customers are stupid. It's a matter of ensuring that the names which identify your business are not used to either identify another business or used in a crude way that can harm your business and destroy the value of your assets. By aggressively defending even close imitations, they send the message not to attempt to co-opt their brand.

And in a world where people are going to ophthalmologists after having put sunscreen on their eyeballs to look at the eclipse in lieu of wearing eclipse glasses, you may be giving too much credit that everyone can tell In-n-Out Double Doubles from Smashburger Triple Doubles."

Ban all aerosols period and re-allow scissors so we can help the stewardesses fight the terrorists ourselves. Oh yeah, those duty free alcohol and the little whiskey bottles the stewardesses serve along with soda pop. Is anybody aware they are flammable and make good improvised Molotov cocktails?"
"Just saying.  Yes we had deficits during the Obama years but let me remind you we had the worst economic crisis since the great depression which started in the GW years.  There were reasons for the deficits.  Now the idiot is going to expand the deficits and for what?  Poor little rich folk won't have to pay taxes as much.  You don't have to be a genius to see where this will head.  Fortunately, the Donald probably will fail once again.  One can always hope."
"More fake news from the lying Globe, they have to keep pumping the propaganda of white genocide."
"The focus of criticism here should not be that the BC Green Party sought moderate (at least in the BC context) donations from a couple of corporations.  The real concern is that they did so while centering their appeal to the voters in significant part on assertions that the BC Liberals and the NDP sought donations from corporate and labour organizations while the Green Party did not.

This is hypocrisy on the Green's part and the fact that the amounts involved were relatively few and small does not make it less hypocritical."
"Surgically removing offending organs is much more civilized than locking a man in a cage for 50 years. Also, we will have to disagree on the effect of long sentences. When the perp benefits from preserving life, I believe they will often do so. Perps may not behave the way we want them to, but that does not mean that they are stupid. If a perp commits a sexual transgression with a 5 year sentence, they still pay a major price if they kill and knock the sentence up to life (or 50 years). Sentences should always be set so as to leave benefit to the perp for not committing further and more serious crime. Killing is the worst crime and its sentence should always be significantly above any other. Some might say killing is not the worst and maybe a sex crime is, but that is just talk. Take a person and give them the choice to be shot in the head or endure an hour of sexual transgression, what do you think they would chose. Death is forever. All else can be endured."

"The protestors are a lunatic so-called fringe of the right, which they aren't.  If counter protestors would just let them march there wouldn't be any violence and they would dissolve like salt in water.  Conservatives don't join them because they are too busy working to support the counter protestors.  Also, they don't have lunatic ideologies.  However, the media in an attempt to destroy conservatives don't care to say this and that is that."

"Homes in the city and near subway stations or homes with a fancy view are understandably expensive.

The less rich or young people with kids went to live in the boonies or suburbs. Understandably, the boonies and suburbs eventually became expensive because the houses are big, new and attractive. People became used to living in the boonies or suburbs. 

The condo and house developers are understandably taking advantage of the people who now want to live in the boonies or suburbs by charging high prices. Same prices as living in the hip popular city neighbourhoods or hip downtown.

People worked hard, saved their money for home, had parents who gave them some money, bought home instead of wasting their time and money on stupid, useless stuff = smart people."

"Dumb idea and quite hypocritical.  Yes Cuba is a repressive regime, but so are many other regimes such as China, Saudi Arabia, Russia etc. who the US trades with and doesn't have such restrictions.  Ultimately more trade means higher standards of living for the Cuban people and as their standards of living rise, there will be greater demands for more freedom.  Democracy is something that comes from within not from the outside."

"Here's a better Q: What in God's name is going on inside the mind of drivers who ""cross over"" smack in2 opposing traffic? This isn't something that occurs in milliseconds. If you were 2 deliberately cross over, it'd still take 2 seconds 2 occur unless you deliberately made as sharp an angle as possible. But ""drifting"" or ""crossing"" by accident surely takes 2 or 3 seconds IF the median is wide like on 470 -- enough time for the idiot driver to correct this unless they are unconscious or having a stroke/heart attack. I doubt most of these cases are sudden-onset medical episodes like seizures. So what is WRONG with these fools? What does it take to realize you just drifted over--the head-on collision? Can't they SEE their vehicle is drifting over & correct this in time? Or is their brain so defective that they can't process the situation fast enough? Or are 100 percent of these idiots in a deep sleep or drunk? I've driven while drowsy and NEVER drifted. Never been drunk, either."
This dude is a total phony.  He does know how to play on the hatred and biases of poorly educated white people though.  Give him credit:  he is a funny entertainer.

Thank you for your attempts to enlighten the ignorant.  Educating folks on this comment board can be a very heavy lift.
"This is quite a mouthful Rob.
I've been a feminist for most of my 82 years . I can't count my early childhood! 
I have to tell you that it would be difficult for a practicing catholic to be a true feminist. Such a person would have to support no abortion rights, a ban on contraception, no women priests & a ban on there ever being a female pope.
To say that women who support free market capitalism would not be welcome in feminist ranks is untrue &  that the same is true for women who work in the energy industry is ridiculous.
Many feminists feel aggrieved at times but 'resentful'? Not the ones I know.
If you really believe the world is not run by a patriarchy, you should think again. Third world countries are overwhelmingly anti- women - how else do you explain honour killings?, the niqab? We`ve made progress in the west but not enough. As is stated in the article & depending on Trump's pick for the next supreme court justice, American women could lose their abortion rights."
The real sad truth is there are a lot of ignorant Americans that will listen to this clowns lies and conspiracies (and everything is a conspiracy) and accept it as truth.
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaa, never surrender! Huh Klastri! Talking about pile of garbage,did you hear  Obama seizing the moment at the UN to raise money.Yes MONEY! Let's not forget that infamous air force one ordeal,where Obama  got caught chasing female reporters with his deadly weapon....you gave him a free pass then,why is that?

 Today we see him hanging out with the elites,where before he used to criticize them,only to become a ""Fat Cat "" himself ? Oh yes! I agree ""Worthless in every way"".
Here's a poll for you; Which president ,Obama or Trump, created more jobs in their first six month in office ? In the meantime ,let me play the Jeopardy song for you. haaaaaaaaaaaa! Imua!"

"Just a reminder to the ignorant that the softwood lumber war has been going on since 1982 and  quite frankly it is Canada's problem, not something that the current government in BC has created or can fix easily or on its own. In the first time in 35 years it is refreshing to hear that BC may take the lead on setting retaliatory measures but we have to remember that this will be the start of a trade war with the US and it will have repercussions from the US that will affect other industry. I am sure the ignorant will then blame Christy Clark for that as well.
Log exports are necessary for a healthy industry, stopping them tomorrow (as NDP) claims they will do, can only kill more jobs.

Do you understand that this man didn't actually use any ""judgment"" and thought to ""declassify"" this top secret information beforehand, that he just blabbed it out without any review or consultation with his experts? That he is the most unqualified buffoon ever to be elected president?"

maybe not. i voted Obama twice even donated to him in 2008 and have a t-shirt to prove it. I am an open minded guy who votes what i think will be for the best. I have been unhappy with Obama's job creation and want to try a different approach.  I do not think the entire left is filled with idiots nor do i think every liberal/progressive is an idiot but I do think the post election hysteria is idiotic. The foot soldiers are mostly idiots being led on by those who stand to make money off it like Michael Moore.

If there is a shutdown, it would prove that we have a bunch of self serving idiots running our state, and should immediately have their pay and benefits suspended."
I find it quite hypocritical that in the same letter it is suggested that the Prime Minister's primary role is to protect the health and safety of citizens while at the same time argues the merits of crippling of one of the primary economic contributors in Canada. I fail to understand how people feel we can on the one hand have health and safety and on the other a stranglehold of our country's primary industries.
I most certainly did not vote for this ridiculous waste of money.

"There is a forth estate no more, don't you read the papers, if you can find one with enough content to cover the story! The news media pandered to the Trump script like egg-sucking dogs and provided us with three or four times the coverage of the email baloney versus substantive issues. And, if there is any merit at all in the claims of people who say that they influenced the election via fake news on Facebook and other venues, we are in deep kimchee as a nation. If one wants to stay informed, it is increasingly difficult to find news sources which are not dominated by op-ed pieces and which have fact-checkable and second source veracity. We follow the news (sic) media (sic) now as we follow gossip columns, day time TV soaps, and cage fighting. There are people now who are gloating about the outcome of the election who cannot wait to possibly intern muslims, build a giant fence around the USofA, and make patty cake with Putin irregardless of nuclear threats in the world. Yikes."
"Why is democracy NOT democratic when a liberal loses?

When Harper won his majority mandate, with 39.7% of the popular vote, for years we were subjected to non-stop braying about how a majority is not a majority with only 39.7% of the vote.

Justin ""wins"" with 39.5% of the popular vote and we are once again subjected to non-stop braying about how this was a clear and decisive win with a strong mandate.

Now Trump didn't win the election, because of the US's electoral system.  Or he did, but it doesn't matter because Hillary ""won"" the popular vote.

Whining about the rules of the game, after you lost, are just the dumbest arguments possible."

That's racist white peoples' problem: they are too insecure and aren't man enough to stand on their own two feet and own their racist views by themselves, so they try to spread their disgusting views to others as a way of diluting their hatred."
"Watch

I'm not shooting anyone so why make such a ridiculous declaration. That's an emotional negative in itself.

What do they care since they suck off the public teat and rely on the government for everything."
"Trump ignored the suffering of 3.4 million AMERICANS to tweet about the NFL.
Is that what you call leadership?

A real leader would offer support and words of encouragement and reassurance. Maybe ask for donations and drum up more interest.

That is what a leader does. A person with no idea how to lead does what Trump did.

Now he is acting like an entitled child tweeting idiotic comments directed at Puerto Rico's leaders. 
He is pathetic.

Trump is more worried about his ego than the 3.4 million Americans in Puerto Rico.
Trump is possibly the worst leader this nation has had the misfortune to have."

Just saying this can be a slippery slope to go down with actual precendt for others that might be abused with "" domestic violence"" not all domestic violence is equal I personally know people that have gone to jail over telling their other half for saying fuck you. Along with women for screaming at their husbands. 
So this can be a slippery slope down the road.

"His friend beat the Delaware criminal justice system.... murder charges dropped and he was set free. Now he's trying to help his friend using same concept, poor black man. He is stupid..... made comment to media that when Smith was arrested for assault, made him cut his hair after that incident, BUT on the night of the shooting he had his dreads intact, that was one of the IDing charateristics. If cut his hair after, shooting makes his friend a co-conspriter."
"What a ridiculous circular argument this author makes: that the restricted supply of a commodity,  low density single family housing, drives up prices of them, but that people don't want to produce or buy her preferred alternative commodity, high density housing, so there's no need to allocate resources to build the low density stuff.  We have plenty of townhome, laneway house and condo developments in the Vancouver area and they aren't holding prices down at all. The answer is to free up land and put more product supply on the market - either that or learn to like the idea of a rich people only city."

"A pathetic attempt to buy our votes with our children's money.  I am as disgusted as everyone with the state of electricity prices in Ontario.  It is abundantly clear that the only reason we pay such rates is mismanagement.

But because the folks who created the contracts were obviously asleep at the switch, there isn't much that can be done in the medium term but suck it up.  I could have an extravagant lifestyle now by spending my retirement savings and maxing out my line of credit.  But that would lead to financial penury in the future.

No, we need a longer term fix.  Either let the existing punishing contracts run their course or challenge them in court for a better deal.  If investing in green sources, make sure there is an economic case as well as an environmental one.  And most important of all, hold officials to account for a little stewardship."

"On James Clapper:

James Clapper resigns as US director of national intelligence - The Guardian, 17 Nov 2016

""In March 2013, months before Snowden provided the Guardian and the Washington Post with voluminous NSA data documenting sweeping domestic and international communications dragnets, Clapper had a public colloquy with Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee.

Wyden asked Clapper: “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions, of Americans?” Clapper replied, untruthfully: “No sir,” rubbing his head. “Not wittingly.” ""

Clapper is famous for having lied under oath to Congress, and the American people, concerning the NSA's surveillance programs. He is also well known for having fired Trump aide Michael Flynn from his directorship at the Defense Intelligence Committee.

Clapper is a proven liar, and a political animal through and through."
The only real racism anymore the what white students face to prevent them from getting a practical education. Successful white students are to be road blocked any way possible  because their own initiative to learn is considered hate crime.
"Catherine, your column was a breath of fresh air. It is high time Canada's chattering classes stopped putting so much emphasis on knee-jerk multiculturalism . . . and started helping everyone become proudly and equally Canadian.  I mean, if people want to behave exactly like they did in their old country, why come to Canada in the first place? 
Besides, multiculturalism is not nearly as a benign as virtue-signalling ""progressives"" like Trudeau would have you believe. For example, under the guise of multiculturalism, Canadian universities are routinely discriminating against white, male applicants/job-seekers. They call it affirmative action, but it is really reverse sexism/racism. And it is disgraceful."
"I do not donate to poorly run institutions that are supported with tax dollars: hospitals.

"Yes, all Jews can sleep tight knowing that the new American president received endorsements from both David Duke and Louis Farrakhan. The incidents of hate crimes - with people sporting the Nazi insignia and bomb threats directed at Jewish institutions, come from Trump's base. He is the only president in our history to receive an endorsement from the KKK. Yeah, all Jews feel so much better."
"Israel is the only friend the US has in the Middle East, and also has nuclear weapons. Would you prefer our nuclear friend to be our enemy, like North Korea? Thanks to Obama's ""no intervention"" policy, NK got nukes during his presidency. Israel serves as a deterrent to any open war against the US from the Middle East. Your calling them ""traitor"" shows your abysmal ignorance  of the geopolitical structure of the world and proves that your opinion is garbage, worth only ignoring. Dismissed!"

It could be that people have contradictory desires. It could be that society enforces contradictory norms. It could be that sex is actually complicated. It could be that some parts of traditional sexual morality were attempts to help negotiate these facts--it could be that love and sex do belong together in some important way. It could be that any attempt to get absolutely consistency here would be false and repressive.
"I'd be really good with getting rid of the bible. As society has progressed through the building of knowledge, as well as a maturity that recognizes that there are plenty of ideas that were acceptable in the past that are now morally repugnant, it has long outgrown the need for a book of fairy tales and myths created by primitive Middle Eastern tribes."
"There are many, many browny jobs on the line; if ( I'm one of them ) don't become President. A slow boat back to their root's. Clinton loves to surround herself with her bro's and sisters, not that white trash. And I seem to remember America intervening in elections abroad?

You people that voted for this dolt are going to be real proud of yourselves when you can't income split this year and your taxes go up $4,000.  Have you thought of that yet? How about when it costs more to heat your home or when you fill up your car because you are going to help Trudeau save the planet?

Well it looks good on the lot of you."
"Mr. Donovan:  I have several times suggested that in my layman's opinion, Mr. Trump is a sociopath.  I have referenced the definition of sociopath and the list of behaviors characterizing sociopathy.  

""Never trust a sociopath. He's a liar. He lies to get his way, he lies to hurt, and sometimes he lies just for his own amusement. A sociopath is extremely skilled at lying, so much so that it always seems as though he's telling the truth. As a pathological liar, a sociopath constantly makes up stories so captivating that people easily believe them."" source Healthy Place   I must say, Mr. Trump has lied all his life...his personal life, his business life, and, now of course, his political life.  Read any site which addresses sociopathy and decide for yourself if you think Trump's a sociopath.  If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....... Gary Crum"

"Here's one example of EWEB stupidity .....   ""EWEB must pay Seneca a per megaWatt-hour rate that amounts to about three times what EWEB pays for power from its main contracted source, the Bonneville Power Administration, the records show.

"Gee, where are all the Trumpnuts today?  Well, they'll be here soon, right after they get their talking points handed to them by the Orange Fuhrer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On February 27, while mired in his ham-fisted attempt to repeal and replace Obama Care, Trump ludicrously observed, “‘Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.”

Now, it seems this politically ignorant neophyte is learning something else everyone else already knew: being president is so complicated, especially when you try to circumvent the US Constitution. Trump is beginning to find out that the presidency is not an entry level position."
Odd that the country that elected someone who brags about being able to grab a woman's pussy would exalt someone who objects to having that happen.

"Your comment is ridiculous. Child protection laws in Canada  are unaffected by this bill. More importantly, there is the legal definition of ""the age of reason"" or age of Majority and Accountability, at which an individual is deemed legally able to make life-changing decisions for themselves...such as driving, drinking, voting, or smoking. In general, that is between the ages of 16 and 18.  A 6 year old child in Canada doesn't have the legal right to make decisions for themselves; what makes you believe, in any credible way, that any court or agency in the country would think a 6 year old (who, legally, isn't even considered mature enough to form the intent to commit a crime) should nevertheless be removed from its family because its wishes regarding gender weren't being respected by its parents? That's a farcical notion bordering on fear mongering. Go back and rethink your argument."

"Assuming the ""everyday Americans"" being referred to are these same idiots and racists that support Trump, I'd say Hillary is definitely not alone in hating such people. Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient. 
It really depends on how you define ""everyday Americans"" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements. 
Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record."

"So, let me get this straight..... Tubby Denny Corderre is happy that the pipe line is cancelled.   He is happy that billions in Canadian Investment and many jobs are foregone.   Interesting.   So, the West provides $11 billion a year to Quebec in equalization payments.   Then Quebec hands over a swack of that to Bombardier.   Bombardier products generate lotsa greenhouse gases.   So, I think that Western Canadians should support the US in terms of their taxation of Bombardier.  Also, given that Quebec imports much of their oil from places like Saudi Arabia and Venezuala then maybe Quebec should be taxed on the upstream effects of that energy source?   Don't even both to tax them....just reduce the Western equalization payments to Quebec to zero......    Yeah, I know, this sounds really, really silly.    Almost as silly as the comments that Coderre (that dumped tons of human waste into the St Lawrence) makes on a regular basis."

Maybe she was divorced...maybe her husband of the first two children left her....or died...you have no clue but that does not stop you from ripping her to shreds.

That’s ok
There is no “horrible history of white subjugation” through racism, slavery or colonialism. So yes, that’s fine. It doesn’t go both ways, just like there is no “reverse racism” 
You can see by the posts here that many, many white people are committed to their racism, see their inability to express their racism as trampling on their god given (socially ordained) right to be racist and reject any invitation to be more sensitive to non-white people. They can’t and won’t. 
So now schools have to act like responsible parents and teach the children (and their parents) the difference between right and wrong."

Why is this story from Reuters and not Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' Washington Post you may ask? Perhaps in retrospect, realizing that tens of billions of his paper wealth could be wiped out with a stroke of Trump's pen in an anti-trust investigation,Bezos wised up and will be toning down his hack-job.

"And just as importantly,  we need to direct resources toward legal immigrants, rewarding their lawful efforts with an efficient and expeditious process. The idea that if you escape detection, take advantage of the system, and come up with a sad story you should somehow cut in line and keep the poor schmuck who followed the rules waiting, makes my blood boil. We need to be diligent in keeping  illegal immigrants out and bringing legal ones in, because the myriad of issues this absurd lack of enforcement has created is drowning our systems. 

And honestly I think that Denver Public Schools officials would just melt into a soggy mess on the playground if we ever get control of immigration. They are so vehement that any change would destroy DPS as we know it.

How does McCain propose to pay for his endless wars?  More taxes?  Or just putting the bill on the US credit card and letting our grandkids pay for it?

The sad thing is the special interests fund idiots like McCain so they can get re-elected and continue to damage our country."

Canadians will realize the stupidity of Carbon Tax for Canada in the next 12  to 24 months as a result of Trump and the USA recognizing the UNFAO 2015 Carbon Flux Model as the replacement model for the 1990's CO2 Emissions Model ...the 2015 model includes both the emissions side and consumption side of CO2e/GHG. The 2015 model recognizes that oceanic/forest sinks consume 65% of the 6.5 units of emissions...the 1990 model totally ignores same.

"Very ill once, had to learn to walk again. Used Skinner Butte daily for uphill strength over twenty five years ago. Even that long ago, it began to decline through human vulgarity. Boxes of gravy cans from the Scari-Marts, syringes, countless orange needle guards, condoms, sex toys, liquor and drug packaging, all the best discards of humanity. That was when my view of ""public"" began straying from assumed positive associations. The kind of people who created such filth have only increased their ranks. They're angrier, randier, and more entrenched, or entrenchedier.
It's worth the fight to get it back, but I doubt the presence of the type of mean genes required for such a fight in Eugene's city-mothers. However, the lovely view of Skinner Butte from my hill in Springfield is enhanced by a forgiving distance and fond memories of border collie companions."

Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?"

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."
"Americans need to forget all thoughts of a normal White House, with a professional staff.  Trump is hiring low life Trump sycophants who drop the f-bomb repeatedly in on-the-record interviews.  Nothing is beneath them.

Between the financial crash and now, Americans have returned to the same level of confidence as before the crash. That is quite a feat... and during this time did we have this Draconian fear and loathing of immigrants we have now? Not until the current king of fear and loathing came along. Pathetic small human beings - as if this great country cannot absorb the fresh set of human beings that want to be here. Sorry if I insult you, but you should really think about your parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents - whoever came over on the boat. My guess is they would be disgusted with the narrow mindedness of their children, grandchildren, or great grandchildren."
What a clever idea.  Now you can blame every problem in the country on a conspiracy of white supremacists.

"Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.  

In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.   

So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead."
Yes it does sound like politics.  Both sides engage in political obstructionism. In Congress it's civil.  At Trump rallies it's nasty and angry.  Big difference.
xbt proof read your comments. If that ain't crying I don't know what is. Like I said man up. You remind me of the Chump. Don't know how a man can be on this earth for more than 70 years and tweet at the level of a seven year old and that might be stretching it a bit.

Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

The republicans have the White House and the majority of the senate and House. That being said even a snail has made more progress than the idiot in chief and his circus of clowns.

"Please God, if I ever complain it's not fair b/c somebody makes more in SSI than I do, and I put on a pink hat and parade about crying about the unfairness of it all, promise me you'll send somebody to put me down. $30,000 a year is a good job, which most people in America would be glad to have. These people make twice that, but it's NEVER enough. They are ungrateful, Hillary loving America haters, and disgusting greedheads to boot."
It must be nice to hide behind your initials and judge people with your racist asinine assumptions.  Using a horrible tragedy for your useless two cents is beyond rude and heartless.    This has to be the most blatantly disrespectful comment I've ever seen.  People and families are grieving.

"What don't you agree with BLM?  The reason why they are protesting or the manner in which they are?   I've seen horrific videos of black men being shot by police officers and the black man in the video was acting COMPLETELY nice, polite, and was NOT a threat to the cop at any level, yet he gets shot in front of his girlfriend, who's also behaving completely appropriate and she watched her boyfriend die right next to her and all they did was have a broken tail light.   The police officer was completely wrong.  How would you feel if that happened to you?   Yes, there are a couple of bad apples that screw it up for the rest, but they are upset about being racially profiled, and there's been a rash of killings of blacks by cops and that's just not right.  Yes, I've seen cops behave inappropriately toward whites too.  I don't know what the problem is, but there are a lot of cops, not all of them, but a lot that have been just not behaving properly and groups like BLM is the result."

"I don't know how ""irresponsible"" [predicting the bombing North Korea] may be.  We're finding out that Trump has committed treason to gain the presidency in the service of the murderous Putin regime.

The Liberals have thoroughly balled up electoral reform and the new fighter aircraft, raised a number of taxes and have already began the sleazy road down to cash for access. Only an idiot would buy the line he is talking up the middle class. I can just imagine the conversation, ""Mr Chang, I'm going to tax the life out of you so the middle class will prosper.

Of course let's just continue to hurl accusations from left to right whilst the real pigs at the trough laugh at our silliness.

"Comparing our Good American president to these spoiled black athletes is wrong, just as they are.   60 years of programs to raise the level of life for the black race in America, and what did it accomplish?  More crime, more fatherless children, and more demands.  'affirmative action' 'The Black Caucus"" 'Black Miss America' 'quotas for black hiring'  'extra credit on SAT scores for black students"" 'quotas for contracts given black contractors'  the list goes on and on, and they are 'protesting' once again.    Ask them this 'what do you want?'  With all I've listed,  it's never enough.  Do they want the police too 'look the other way' when 6% of the population (black males) are doing crime?  When 6% of the population makes up over half of the prison population?  It's what and who they are, not what they imagine."
Carl Bernstein is a  typical Liberal hypocrite watchdog. He was Johnny-on-the-Spot when the Republican Nixon Administration took 1 (one) FBI File. But was no-where to be found when the Democrat Clinton Administration took 300 FBI Files. Now he's a Johnny-on-the-Spot again.

"Let's get to the heart of the matter. This really all started with the removal of Confederate Statues - the liberal people who are so tolerant - pardon me, intolerant.

As a side note anyone who wants to disbelieve that the alt left had nothing to do with the violence - as disgusting as it was - better rethink that....."
"Anti-racists say there is a RACE problem that can only be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and ""assimilates.""

What if I said there was a RACE problem that could only be solved if hundreds of millions of non-Blacks were brought into EVERY Black country? How long before people realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem, but the conclusion to the BLACK problem?

They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.

Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White."

Now we can spend even more money on a worthless going nowhere project that our absolute liar-thief-con man of a governor wants to leave as his “legacy”. What a joke and an expensive one at that. This is NOT helping us get closer to new revenue and a sustainable budget. Get real people.

"""President Donald Trump’s racially fraught comments about a deadly neo-Nazi rally have thrust into the open...""
What specifically did he say which was ""racially fraught""? I'm not gonna waste my time reading the rest of this garbage."
And your comments to Hab fans mean nothing..  Stay in the Nation of losers.....
They can sneer all they want. Governor Walker is the only person with the guts of put forward a plan to get us out of this mess. All these legislators are just cowards and clowns.
"Its a damn shame that people resort to bashing a man who is genuinely trying to do the right thing for our country and her citizens because they can't handle or control him. It just pisses them off that Trump won't play the puppet and is strong and relentless in getting things done his way. I'm sure they also realize that President Trumps fantastic work ethic and determination makes theirs look inadequate and incompetent. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. President. Eventually, those weak, scared, simpleminded, self-serving, unethical, and greedy haters will eventually asphyxiate on their own bullshit."
Disgusting. The Liberals continue to debase and devalue Canadian citizenship for partisan reasons.
"The big question about all this uproar, fire and anger is who does it affect? How many transgender students are there in Alaska? Do we have more than 1? More than 2? Yeah I'm deplorable for asking, but is this even an issue for us? 

Are transgender kids in Anchorage suffering, if there are any?"
Not Islamo Facists.
Being a small minded and nasty person who is lacking in emotional and spiritual maturiyt and whose ministry is basically scamming gullible people out of money certainly strike me as disqualifications to the priesthood.  And I'd prefer that the right men (and sadly it is still only men) enter the priesthood rather than ordaining anything with a pulse.   We really don't need immature woman hating men who want to play Latin Mass dress up and act like little dictators becoming priests.  They do so much to chase people out of the Church.
Contraception is a sin for morons.
"There is no law in Colorado that says I have to respect anything. I do not respect the baker or his beliefs. I do not respect the gays who wanted a cake or their beliefs.

No matter if you respect anything, you are obliged to follow state law. The baker agreed to follow state law and then he violated it. He could move to a different state and discrimanate against gays all the live long day, legally."
"As someone who supports the president I find your comment about the KKK laughable as your ignorance on the subject.  It was the Democrats who supported the KKK, it was Democratic governors who would not allow blacks in the white schools.  Robert Byrd a Democrat Senator from West Virginia was a grand cleagle of the Klan. As far as Mr James another ignorant  democrat"
You might want to read the treaties. Most of what is given today is not in the treaty. Our ancestors were not stupid either.
"What a load of crap! It astounds me that someone of this author's stature would go by the word of people who write for the NYT, that is known for peddling Putin bashing fake news. If Putin was such a tyrant and a strong arm dictator why would his ratings be the highest of ANY statesman currently AND is widely popular with his fellow compatriots?
Also, the Crimea wasn't ""annexed"" but was legally taken back through an internatinally recognised referendum where 95% of the population voted to be incorporated back into the Russian Federatoon. If this author had done her research properly she would have known this and  discovered other real facts of the Russian Leader.  She selectively picks negative moments about Putin from the Oliver Stone interviews for the purposes of this article to fit her story in comparison to JZ the idiot. Had she done her homework properly she would also have learnt, thanks to Putin, that European and Asian countries are joining the SCO to improve trade relations."
"Sanders said. “He was simply making a comment, making a joke, and it was nothing more than that.”
The Donald made a joke? I doubt it. Not funny. I know he thinks he's funny with his funny hair, bigly red tie and tiny hands, but he's just pathetic. Believe me."

What cynical  garbage from a Liberal troll.  PR is by far the best alternate system. What you get in the percentage of the popular vote is what you get in th house. It's called real representative democracy. Not the dysfunctional crap we have now. NDP or no NDP. It's bigger than petty party politics Canadians deserve a better democracy than this.   The Liberals have blown a huge opportunity and will pay dearly with progressives who hold this issue dear. Liberals once agin prove than cannot be trusted.
Who exactly are the people dumb enough to not understand that by 'tax reform' the GOP means 'the rich pay less and the middle class and poor either get fewer government services or they pay more of the burden themselves...'

The big problem with this country is unsustainable government, instead of controlling cost the establishment prefers to discuss cramming more people into city's who's infrastructure has already collapsed.

"New York City Trump and his billionaire friends would not let the average Trump voter mow his Mar-a-Lago lawn.

As a plus though..we now can openly be racist thanks Don and his followers. By the way..I work in the oil industry of North Alaska..I make a good living..have good insurance....and I see right through Donald Trump."
"Trump has long praised Canada's system and I think most Canadians would have to agree that, on balance, it has worked well for us. However, if I were an American I would be concerned about the idea of so significantly reducing the number of immigrants. Most economists and demographers would tell you that, to meet its targets for  economic growth, America needs many more immigrants, what with declining birth rates, massive deportations and entry level jobs going unfilled. And the limit of 50,000 refugees for a country as big and rich as the US is pathetic, not to mention dangerous"

"The rubbish man comment was used as a literary device to place Mr Rhyner in the shoes of his British doppelganger, I actually have never had a problem with the fact that Mr Rhyner worked for Municipal Waste, Im also sure that he was good at his job and deservedly compensated, and makes the most of his generous retirement. What I have a philosophical problem with is his never ending hypocracy regarding anybody else who get up and go to work every morning and do their ""jobs"" whether represented by organized labor or not. Consistantly opining that people are not doing a ""worthwhile job"" or are overcompensated,or unionized is simply audacious."

"Shirley A. Coté - How many members of the public have the Anchorage police killed this year? I think it was 2014 when ya-all killed five people for such heinous crimes as traffic violations and being homeless. Do you perhaps hope that us rallying around you will keep you safe from the bullets headed your way?

And, no, I'm not condoning the killing of police officers. I'm simply pointing out that you all are hypocrites in need of some intense self-evaluation over why people would want to shoot at you. The public didn't start the war, so maybe you shouldn't ask for our help until you've done what it takes to ease the tension. It might start with an acknowledgement that traffic violations and exercising the 2nd amendment are not reasonable reasons to mete out the death penalty without a trial.

Until you do that, you don't have my support and I don't think you should have anyone else's either, though people are free to make that choice for themselves."

The problem with religious actions like this is people wasting all that energy and resources on something that is not even real! So that is why I say pathetic- someone trying but failing majorly to do any good. 
And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.) When you perceive reality as a slur, you need to examine your beliefs. I suggest doing what Descartes did- doubt all that you believe to be true, *everything*."

"I stand corrected on the gender.  You will note that I pointed out that we have our share of lamentable events, so I hardly think we should focus on only happy ones, but a an elected official who finds it hard to celebrate our sesquicentennial is, to my mind, an embarassment to Canadians and one who has demonstrated shame in her country.

I am having difficulty understanding your interpretation of her statement.  What she said was ""On the one hand, it’s hard to celebrate the past 150 years – a history of colonization, denial and failed promises "", clearly not pre-Confederation history, and a very one sided view of our history.  

No nation is without its share of skeletons in the closet, and I am not one to support hiding them, since we must learn from the mistakes of the past.  But I believe there is much to be proud of over the last 150 years as well."
"Yes the antifas are a bunch of juvenile half-wits running around smashing windows.  But there are a lot of them, and they are creating a lot of destructive violence.  The fringe right is a much much smaller group of idiots spouting garbage and who get zero support from 99.5% of Trump supporters. For the most part they are harmless and ignored.  To suggest every one potesting the removal of the statues is explicitly supporting white nationalist 100% is completely irresponsible of the Globe & Mail.  The small right fringe is generally less violent than the much larger fringe left, and yes the right fringe are reprehensible and should be squashed.  But what angers the right is when MSM tries to pretend that Trump and every one of his supporters supports the extreme.  Just because someone is anti Trump I don't assume he is an ISIS supporter who believes in wiping the world of all non Muslims."

"@Kukailimoku, I think @John Kawamoto has it right.

At a December 2015 rally in Charleston, South Carolina, just a few days after the San Bernardino shooting, Trump told thousands of supporters:

""Donald J. Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.""

I read ""complete and total"" to mean ""all"", don't you?"
"Yeah, but watch all the Democrats and their supporters in Canada falling into line as soon as USA starts bombing, whether N Korea or Venezuela; just like they fell in line when Trump fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria based on no evidence / fake news that Syria had used chemical weapons."

"Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump.
She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.
She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter.
She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump."

"This feels a little bit like trying to read tea leaves or something, but what the heck. Here's my interpretation:

The shooter by some measure led a successful life. But something wasn't right. Some bitterness, some poison in the well of their soul. They were really rejecting the rest of a life that seemed destined not to improve in whatever material or spiritual way it felt broken. They committed to something atrocious, perhaps an expression of how they felt about their world.

Maybe events like these are like mineshaft canaries that attack instead of just die. They're an indicator that our society collectively is failing itself in substantial ways. I imagine that most people who want to see progress in the world feel a similar sense of malaise, they're just more optimistic, moral, or willfully benevolent-minded. That can be a matter of culture, and it seems lately we've been gestating sociopathic and divisive culture instead for petty and depraved political establishment's purpose."
"The current occupant of the Oval Office has a long history of stiffing his contractors.  Every day he's benefiting financially from his position, something our Constitution explicitly enjoins.  He has zero moral authority.  

It's easy for a rich money grubber to claim he's not beholden to anyone.  (He also pretends to give to charity, even though the money he passes along from his foundation was actually given by others.)  

At least the Kochs, rapacious and uncaring fat cats, don't make any claims to represent the ""little guy"".  Drumpf, on the other hand, is nothing but an opportunistic narcissist and hypocrite."
"True, but not as much as the shitheads who pack illegals into a hot trailer and drive them to their deaths.

PERIOD."
Every business that man has touched has failed and yet he has taken money from people to make himself filthy rich.   You don't think he would be okay with those bonuses only shows you are part of the problem and not the solution.

"Low-IQ Donald figured out one clever thing:  If you can have a very loyal 30-something percent base, you have a chance to compete in most any election.  All it took was a few Hillary careless errors and the Russian fake news campaign to get him into the White House.

The Republican senators and reps saw what happened, and now they're afraid to fight Trump and his base.  The proof is in the few who are retiring (McCain, Flake, Collins, etc.); having nothing to lose, they ALL say what an idiot he is.

But now that he's done little to help America, especially the undereducated whites who voted him in, that 30-something percent will not be enough next time--if there is a next time."
Traitorous and cowardly leftists are perfectly fine with this.
If the shooter was Muslim the right would have no problem “playing politics”.  Fox News and our fkkkg moron in charge would call for a Muslim ban.  Since the shooter was white their agenda has been derailed.
"Where did they say he refused to make ANY custom cake? He said he would make a birthday cake. He refused to make a custom cake for a specific event, a gay wedding, that was against his beliefs, actually the same concept as not making a cake celebrating  Halloween.

"Good questions. I only stated that the registration of Muslims, not necessarily an injustice in itself, seems reasonable if high rates of crime, of a particular nature,  can be identified with a particular group of people.  Hypothetical references to whites and blacks do not defeat the above statement. 

Now that I think about it, the fact of the matter is that Black violence in America does exceed the violence committed by Muslims in this country. But if we knew that their was a particular widespread segment of the Black population  advancing a particular ideology through violence, the society would not hesitate to cast some sort of  blanket over Blacks in general as a means to combat the violence. Would this be wrong?  It all comes down to the actual or potential violence that the society is responding to. Violence can rip a country apart and destroy the very foundations of a society leading to even greater death and destruction. You have to be realistic about these things"

If Congress acted, it would not change much and would essentially ratify the current law, with some possible protection for Downs babies (probably not, however).

No. Everyone on Capitol Hill laughs at him behind his back (except the people who worship him, and these people are irredeemably corrupt) as though he's some idiot that got into his job position because his dad knew someone. Trump has always been reluctant to work an honest day's work that's why he CHEATS at everything he does. This guy hasn't worked an honest day in his life. The question is why do Americans allow such a person to occupy the most hallowed position in their society? The answer: they have deplorably low standards for themselves and their children.

The Republican Party emerged from a coalition of frustrated free-soilers, wandering Whigs, and disillusioned northern Democrats. And note that the party didn’t oppose slavery on moral grounds, but on economic and political ones.

"...(cont'd from above)...


John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant in his 1989 book: ""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”

 Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.

Trump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US

Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.

It's why you run with this chicken)(*& bs about scholars. It's plainly written there is none that doeth good, no not one. You say the Bible is a liar, you do good, you chose to love Jesus and yet the same Bible plainly states ALL rejected Christ. It is beyond your intellect to grasp faith is a gift from your imaginary God, unless he gives it to you it is impossible to believe. You call your god a liar and claim you believed of your imagined free will. that faith is a product of your will.

"Pardon me if I do not share the editorial board's amusement at Trudeau 2.0's arrogant, stubborn, authoritarian and excruciatingly embarrassing performance in the House last Wednesday.

In conjunction with attempts to change the electoral system to ensure  perpetual power for the Liberals (preferential balloting),  to muzzle parliamentary debate (motion 6) and to marginalize parliament (making it a four day a week with over a dozen weeks off institution and freeing the PM to get away with just 45 minutes a week in the chambre), the PM's outright and brazen refusal to provide any relevant, substantive answers to opposition questions that reached its pinnacle last week. is infuriating and worrisome rather than amusing to me.

It is the kind of thing that is usually more associated with regimes like the ones in Venezuela, Zimbabwe,  North Korea  and with two of Trudeau's personal favourites China and Cuba than with Canada.

"When I started work for the State of Oregon in 1998, part of the incoming indoctrination was a presentation about computers.

(There were still big thick newspapers back then.) 

When I was first granted a Security Clearance, part of the three-hour interview and briefing was to point out all the bad things that could happen to my country and to me personally if I revealed Classified information.

Arrogance, hubris and stupidity were the main ingredients for this bit of political theater."
"In 2014, the Colorado Civil Rights Division appeared to make two conflicting and hypocritical rulings. In one case (Masterpiece Bakery) it ruled that the baker was wrong for declining to decorate a cake with pro-gay decorations; in the other case (Azucar Bakery) it ruled that the baker was well within their rights to refuse to bake decorate a cake with anti-gay decorations. Both cases involve the supposed right of each baker to pick and choose what artistic messages they wanted their artistic talents to convey. The CCRD apparently decreed that one ""artistic refusal"" was fine while the other ""artistic refusal"" was wrong when both ""artistic refusals"" involved the same issue: Gays. The State cannot decree that one form of ""artistic integrity based on personal beliefs"" is wrong while another is fine/legal without being what it is: The Colorado Civil Rights Division Where Hypocrisy Rules. I imagine the US Supreme Court is going to have a field day exposing this hypocrisy."
"I posted this comment, making fun of myself: ""That's it. I'll dress as a fat, balding, one-legged white guy. No, wait -- that'll offend my wife -- at least, it seems to.""  Other readers deemed it uncivil.  

I am a fat (slightly) balding (very) one-legged white guy.  

A little nuance, please: if you trick yourself out at Hallowe'en to look like Al Jolson and run around calling people mammy, or maybe dress as Hitler, you're being offensive and someone should probably tell you to get lost.  But to wear a kimono because you think it would be a cool costume?  Geez.  I think half the problem is that school boards have to deal with ornery adolescents who sometimes do provocative (and sometimes stupid) things to get attention, so they just ban everything.  Also, they have to deal with the phone calls from a handful of semi-functional and constantly irate parents who complain about everything.

Maybe I'll dress as Iggy Pop and yell ""no fun."""

It worked fine up to the 16th century. Besides, today's judges, especially in the U.S. are not much different from the medieval clergy in their arrogance and corruption."
"About half the clergy is homosexual, some chaste some not. The other half is asexual. Believing that God denies sexuality to people born homosexual casts God as an Ogre. Why do you think God is an Ogre? Why must we believe unconcious asexuals like Plato, Augustine, Marcus Aurellius, St. Paul and Aquinas when they try to assume their own sexuality is universal? The Sensus Fidelium says we don’t. Humanae Vitae was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Until the Church faces its origins problem in sexual teaching and lets the asexual clergy be out and proud, the rest of us will simply ignore it in our sexuality. And, no, Jesus was not asexual. He was a working Rabbi with a wife. He had a house in Capernaum when he called his disciples. It likely doubled as a Synagogue."
These rating probably aren't even right. Cry babies just want to try make it seem like they are making a difference. None of the players are kneeling to disrespect the flag or america. Do any of you idiots out there that want the nfl banned. Think about all the players who all ways stand and the players who have served before. The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.

"The per vote subsidy was garbage. Please explain to me why past election results should affect the funding for the current election?

The funding model provides an unfair advantage to the incumbent government and disadvantages any new party that did not previously participate in the previous election (Pure Chretien).

The current model of providing a decreasing tax credit for personal contributions levels the playing field for the middle class donors.  The rich will donate the maximum regardless.  The tax credit makes donating more attractive to people who don't donate the maximum and instead make small contributions (say $10-20 per month) based on what they can afford.

If you want to get rid of personal donations entirely because your party's supporters don't donate then lets discuss that but the per vote subsidy is a very poor funding model to use as a replacement."

That could be construed to include livestock couldn't it? After all, livestock live on the landscape too. The private property owners might not appreciate the sentiment though. Similarly those bison were put there by the people of Alaska, ADF&G, the USFWS, the Canadians, and the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. They were put there for conservation, not for some jerk to illegally subsistence-shoot them. If you dislike people getting ticked about the disregard for the existing laws in the bush, talk to the people who break those laws, please don't cry wolf about people voicing their concerns about an imbalance in law enforcement.There's nothing racist about a double standard application in the law.

"You can easily go a few miles east and access the glacier by the east side of Lion's head mountain and skip all these crazy people charging admission.  Just a little rappelling and you are on the stagnant part of the glacier about 3 miles back and can travel without having to pay anyone.

Another alternative is taking a heli flight and skiing and walking on the upper glacier area.

"“In my opinion it’s trash and garbage,” Choy said. “Is there a way we can not spend $2 million on storing stuff and spend it on, I don’t know, buying plate lunches for these guys?”

Talk about a disconnect between what non-homeless people think the homeless care about, and what homeless people actually care about. A plate lunch is a short-term victory. Holding onto possessions when you don't even have a home is much more meaningful to a person. What's trash to one man is another man's treasure."

"Progressives aren't going to fire progressives. Moreover tenure prevents it. What I would like to see is nationally televised Congressional hearings on the state of American education. Think of a hack like UC Chancellor Janet Napolitano being asked to explain why she accommodated black students' demands for segregated college dorms, or a public school supervisor being asked explain why kindergarten classes should have the transgender agenda--in all its scientifically unproven glory--rammed down their throats."
"There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads. 



Dems always think that ""the media"" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans ""go there"" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire.

It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by ""the tone."" More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did.

Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game.

We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve."
"The Huffington Post took the correct approach by publishing a disclaimer: "" Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."" 
It really ought add a little to that:Trump suffers from narcisstic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder ,bipolar mood disorder and ADHD. He also has some form of delusional thought disorder or paranoia. trump is insane."

"LoL. Trump is not an ideologue, not much of a Conservative and he's a New York Republican. He ran on a clear platform and the Republican establishment is denying it to him. However, while pundits are speculating about splits, President Trump has the party membership in his back pocket. And they are more than willing to give him a benefit of the doubt. Not so with the Republican leadership. They no longer have any chips on the table, not after the repeal failure. I'm betting that Trump will not even have to deal with the opposing Republicans in Congress. The rank and file will castrate them for him."

Choosing to sit for the anthem has meant that their issues have been lost in the emotion. BTW, I'm a veteran."
"Sad to say once again our utterly incompetent elected bureaucrats can't identify the real problem. As in city & state has a wasteful spending problem, not a tax funding problem.

Audit after audit has uncovered massive waste, fraud, utter incompetence in city & state government operations. Nothing of substance has been done to stop it.

City & state should look at ways to move new hires to the 401k retirement plans. Reduce the endless money pit pension problem.

"Trump is an ugly speaking man - no question.  Tabloid entertainment in US whether acting under the guise of news media, reality tv, or talk shows, has lend itself to electing such a man to be President.

What I still cannot believe is how the Globe editors and journalist are in such denial that they are complicit in the ugliness.  First, since they are all in terribly declining business models, inflaming the situation to get viewership has been an absolute focus. Second, they are consumed with the subject at the expense of focusing on real issues and potential solutions and the pros and cons of those choices and solutions. 

Doyle quoted ""The Truth"".  Here is the truth, the vast majority of us are discounting everything your saying since its just so one sided and never ending.  

Trump behavior is ugly, the established Media's behavior is one sided = the combination is that both will be gone in four or five years."

"This week, our Pope, in a homily stated that gay men are not fit to be priests basically because they are feminine, he made jokes about how an old cleric was making fun of a new priest because he was examining his look in his fancy clerical garb just like a woman would.  

Gender segregation is a split by gender.  Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.

Celibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not."

"The Fang-Chang Gang have also been very heavy-handed in trying to get rid of the downtown summer market since its inception more than 20 years ago, mistakenly believing that the market has been responsible for the declining sales at their downtown gift shops, rather than acknowledging the REAL problem they face, which is probably declining customer interest in their ticky-tacky made in China crap."

"Isn't this getting a bit ridiculous when school boards go LOOKING for offence as they continue their hyper-sensitive assault on public space?  Newsflash: students usually pick costumes to make themselves look different -- the more exotic, the better. I have even heard complaints about Hallowe'en itself from overly-sensitive parents, as if their children were making a deal with 'the devil', a fictional character. Let's stop looking for offence. Don't mention any skin colour, nor any culture, nor any religion -- now, what costume can a child choose? Well, any item of clothing 'hints' at some cultural origin, so should children wear sheets -- or is there an odious connection there?  Must all children cover themselves from head to toe in the same drab garment in order to conceal themselves completely? Would that satisfy the hyper-sensitive social engineers? Diversity is bad when it comes to costumes? Cancel fun & Hallowe'en for educrats?  Let the kids be kids!"

"Larry, you and Johnny Mabry have a fixation.  But ""terror"" is bad, no matter the justification. Can you agree?
- Sikh temple murders: religious terrorism. Shooter thought he was murdering Muslims.
- Jewish center murders by a Nazi and Klan member: Thought he was murdering Jews.

Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.

Of course, Roof murdered 9 innocents in a church not because of their faith, but their race.  Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.

The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.

The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many ""Christian"" groups, demonize homosexuality. So, unstable in part because of faith, but by what his faith did to him, not what he was supposedly doing for Allah."
"This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon.

These people don't care about fines, jail,court cases, criminal records etc. as it only enhances their prestige amongst the community they live in. So they continue their lives of crime as that other stuff is for people who care. The people who care and will pay the debts are busted with DUIs, small drug posession charges, fines for irreverent behaviour and otherwise nickel and dimed to death for minor but, lucrative crimes.

It does nothing to deter criminals.'' in the case of your grifter-in-chief and his fellow cons surrounding him you couldn't be more correct, but for the general public laws are deterrents and society benefits, the minority who break them stand to be busted. why am I not surprised it has to be explained?"
"Some good points made here. The article does ""conveniently"" tie in nicely with the reduction of wealth and opportunity for the 99%.

One thing not mentioned is related to the fact that rental stuff is often crap. Rather than buy a circular saw for a small project a few years ago, I rented. The saw was so poorly maintained it wouldn't cut straight. So I returned it and got another. Same problem. All I got was a shrug from the rental company. If I had bought the saw it would have done the job easily and properly.

Now I suppose if rental were the norm, as in short term car rental, that might change. But the rental business is also sometimes a license for rip-off. For example. you can't convince me that leasing a car long term is anywhere near as advantageous as outright ownership. It's an expensive pain in the butt, only useful if you're able to write it off at tax time."

But yet we hear nothing from this old dinosaurs teamates in the media. A piece of advice that I hope the media doesn't follow. We elected Trump because of his temperament.

Child rape case 1994, filed in April 2016. The case is quite credible given his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who pimped children for rich guy parties. Trump praised Epstein on occasion as liking to surround himself with beautiful women, and some of them are young...

Tiffany Doe in the case said, her party planner duties were “to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.” 

She stated, ""I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old."""

"I would think Secretary Clinton would be a more accomplished liar considering how often she does it.  At the debate she showed just how dumb she thinks we all are when she said 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia is behind the email leaks that are damaging her image.

What Clinton said was false and misleading. First of all, only two intelligence entities – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – have weighed in on this issue, not 17 intelligence agencies. And what they said was ambiguous about Russian involvement. And what they said was ambiguous about Russian involvement. . . . are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.

Saying that they are consistent with other Russian-directed efforts is not the same that Russia is definitively behind it."

I'm not the one assuming that people that would come for a moose and bounty would be jack asses nor that it would even operate on such a basis. My guess is no advertisement would be needed and those one scene or shortly thereby would take care of the problem even before the LEO left the scene. And they wouldn't necessarily be jackasses... Only needy families would butcher a road kill moose for $200 btw... Its far easier to make $200 by other means. If that's not true then why is the bounty so high now? If that is too high then lower it until only those who valued the meat would spend the time and effort and remove the financial incentive. And if the idea now is to give it to needy families why all the hate for a needy family saving them the trouble?

"Trump might want to learn there is an agreement called NAFTA which prohibits import tariffs on the three countries in it.  Until he cancels it, US companies have the right to import goods for Mexico tariff free and even if he cancels it, only congress can apply tariffs and most Republicans are still pro free trade.  It was Ronald Reagan who brought free trade and many Republicans identify more with him than Trump.  This is another dumb idea from Trump who is economically illiterate."

"KKK leader says that he is 'glad' about Heather Heyer's death

“I'm sorta glad that them people got hit and I'm glad that girl died,” Justin Moore “a Grand Dragon” in a KKK organization, told WBTV.


Heather Heyer was run down and killed by neo-Nazi James Fields on Saturday. 


“They were a bunch of Communists out there protesting against somebody's freedom of speech, so it doesn't bother me that they got hurt at all.”


The voicemail for the group’s phone number also praises Fields.
“Nothing makes us more proud at the KKK than we see white patriots such as James Fields Jr, age 20, taking his car and running over nine communist anti-fascist, killing one n----r-lover named Heather Heyer,” the hateful message said."

You got compensated for something that happened over 50 years ago, and you consider yourself unlucky and misused for events following your case. Did you ever consider just leaving the whole paraphernalia of abuse, SNAP, lawyers, etc  behind you after you got the settlement and pursuing other interests.

I have to wonder why we have such an increase in crime this past year.  Is it because we don't have enough police and people actually think they'll get away with it?  Is it because of drug addictions? Gang activity?  Lack of jobs?  No decent health care?  Crummy wages?  Idiots for parents?  Escaping the law from the Lower 48?  Homelessness?
"This is where Trump's dirty Denier lies will be given full play. And like a good fascist he will try to erase all truths he doesn't like. Like the sleazebag he is, he will probably claim he is just a useless ""skeptic"".

Actually this story proves that Harper 9 years ago was just as big of a right wing freak zealot as Trump, with his contempt for learning, his hatred of environmental protection and his dangerous irresponsible Denier stance.

Now we have finally gotten rid of Harpo, suddenly the Brad Walls and federal conservatives have a new Denier Hero."

"Thankfully Assad can be toppled without ""going to war"". It's rather amusing to see how the left are trying to push Trump into a corner where they can justify calling him a hawk, foolish.

""Is toppling Assad worth war for US"", I think that same question was asked regarding Hitler. If you have the capabilities to aid and assist the distressed you have a moral obligation to do so. However, if you can convince yourself that morals are just relative, then I guess you can just sit on the sidelines and hypothesize about the situation."

"The Republicans longest running lie is that they don't recruit white racists into the GOP. That recruitment started with Barry Goldwater. They have been very successful with their recruitment efforts. I remember when Ronald Reagan kicked off his successful run for president with a speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That town was famous for one thing, the murder of Swerner, Goodman, and Chaney. They were murdered for registering black folks to vote in the 1960's. The Christian KKK did the deed with the help of local law enforcement. The crowd of white folks loved his speech."

"Exciting times! Both the Liberals and the NDP lost this one. This is not a matter of rural versus urban, its a battle between the willful ignorant and simply the ignorant. The policies that really matter, regardless of what people are willing to admit, are the environmental issues which both the NDP and the Liberals are ignoring (hence the reference to ignorance above). Unfortunately the Liberals, who I have supported for years, don't understand that there are many people who want prosperity but not at the cost of everything else.  We will only tolerate willful ignorance of global environmental issues for so long before we are willing to throw away a vote to instigate change. Given the success of the Green Party this election I am willing to cut them a lot of slack in hope of an even better showing next time....unless the other parties get with the program. My message to Liberals and NDP is to wake up, but it will take a significant sacrifice in your current ideology. Dinosaurs die."

What good are the nuclear stockpiles of the US when they can't be used and don't think for a moment countries don't know that.

The idiot at the helm is a political juvenile with a mental imbalance. He hasn't a clue of how the world works now and is intertwined.

Would you use the phrase ""Black privilege"" in talking about the disproportionate success of Blacks in basketball, football, track and field? Would you use that term to refer to affirmative action? I doubt it. 

This is the problem with the vocabulary of ""social justice."" Like religion, it invents a sin lexicon to guilt and shame society into submitting to the tyranny of an artificial equality achieved by rule of law and social pressure. That's partially why 60 million Americans - fed up with the liberal shame game - just voted in a boorish, vulgar president who seems incapable of shame.

I'm sure there are many reasons why the young leave the Church, and several of those would be troubling to traditionalists.

"This is, in a word, delicious.

Why?

Because eventually, a DNC member will apologize that they did not understand that they were hitting the 'send'  button rather than the 'delete'  button.

The only person, and I mean the ONLY person that is less trustworthy than Hillary Clinton is the leader of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has rigged the election from the Democrat side from the beginning.

Think I am wrong, liberals?

Just wait.

So. That said.

I, for one, do not trust for a second that this was a breach that was taken by the Russians, but was instead, given unto them.

Why do I believe this?

Because personal information was not taken from any other part of the site.

I really wonder why this is.

Yeah, yeah, detractors will state that Trumps website and the RNC's website were attacked as well.

Given federal law, anyone in an ER must be treated - this is paid for via taxes and higher costs to those who have insurance or pay out of pocket. One reasons for the PPACA was to address the prior cost structure; support hospitals in ER costs; prevention to reduce ER visits; mandate annual check ups; maternal care; etc. to reduce costs.  The proposed AHCA will not cover maternal, wellness, or mental health - stupid."
"Must suck to be so insecure that one is threatened by love between two human beings, how human beings identify etc"
Junk science. Fewer than 1% of species have gone extinct in recent human history. Mass extinctions usually kill off somewhere in the neighborhood of 90%.
"Lets talk about Bernstein's investigative reporting that he has been living off of for the last thirty some years. He was handed the story by Deep Throat, a disgruntled FBI 2nd in command who was passed over for promotion. Even then he was screwing it up and had to continually be corrected by DT. The story forced Nixon to resign, that is why he has been supported for his whole career by the Democrat Media. He is a Shill. The Russian FakeStory didn't stick so now in concert the new FakeStory is that he is crazy. They can't quit though. Like the ""Buggy Whip"" they are ""Passe."""
"All smoke and mirrors, a lot talk and flash but nothing that actually gets done except pissing off our friends around the world, Trump is a con man using used car salesman talk, and apologize to used car salesman.  Trump and team know they can BS their supporters who are more reality TV type folks, easy to hoodwink."

It's as if you're hinting at something rather than being clear.
As if to be explicit on what you are writing  would make the article ridiculous."
"This is blatant disregard for rules and regulations. The ethics commissioner cannot rule on this, as  they are always biased. Criminal charges should be levied and the donations returned. Dirty Politics! Trudeau the hypocrite."
Your hypocrisy and bias is unbelievable.  That's exactly what we get from the right-wing crowd
"The planners are punishing Eastmoreland for their neighborhood association's leadership on livability.  Robert McCullough is my hero- he takes care of the SE Uplift area, and helps residents of less fancy neighborhoods.

Hopefully Mayor Wheeler will clean house when it comes to our current group of city planners,  they are inept idealogues.."
"perhaps Alberta should claim that shutting down all railway lines coming from BC into Alberta and all BC highways coming into Alberta should be closed ""in the national interest"".  Since BC is so adamant about shutting down the new TMP, Alberta should agree with BC and shut down the OLD TPM immediately.  And oh, by the way, all the gas & oil that BC produces and ships through pipelines that go through Alberta... you guessed it.... these need to be stopped ... because they are not n the ""national interest"".

This is the way silly little children play games... not a supposed 1st world country. This country is bound and determined to becoming a 3rd world country."
"Glad to see your continued support of rapists, predators and the like."

"RichardCory> you nailed your fellow hypocrite Democrats down perfectly! Care to tell us what happened to the CBS lawyer whom had no sympathy for Republicans? LOL

The 5 Worst/Recent Mass Murders in the USA (with a Firearm) Came from Democrats 
* Ft Hood: Registered Democrat/Muslim.
* Columbine: Too young to vote; both families were registered Democrats and progressive liberals.
* Virginia Tech: Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff.
* Colorado Theater: Registered Democrat; staff worker on the Obama campaign; Occupy Wall Street participant; progressive liberal.
* Connecticut School Shooter: Registered Democrat; hated Christians."
"Hollywood is eating it's own!  It's pure cannibalism!

Ratner looks like he could easily get fingered for a crime if what is alleged proves true.  However, Dustin Hoffman sexually harassing/flirting with an intern 32 years ago does not sound like something even worth reporting now."
Russia needs to employ more intelligent writers. You garbage is an embarrassment to your fellows in the Russia web brigade.
Kasich is an egotistical moron!  More absorbed with his own self importance than anything else.  I would vote for Donald Duck before I would vote for this loser!
"The Democrats have made an ass of themselves period 

They are beyond desperate, the slow drip of corruption will tail them for years.

Sure they were hacked, the hacks only exposed what everyday Americans always suspected- hence Trump.

Let them crawl, they deserve nothing better!!!!

Go Trump."
Does the Finance Minister even have a clue how foolish he sounds? This is not the first time he has been exposed in this way. Private fundraisers with wealthy people should be against the law. Same old Liberals.
Trudeau is too busy doing favors for communists to be bothered with what you and your ilk think. You voted for this moron and deserve this crap.  Canadians come last with this piece of garbage.

No excuse for this sociopath."
"Articles such as this should point out that these facial covers are political - not religious - instruments, according to many observers, who have pointed out that these full-cover facial instruments have skyrocketed in recent decades and were not widespread in previous decades.

One such published account you can find online is called ""How the Veil Conquered Cairo University"". There you can see college graduation photos in Egypt of decades ago, where the hair and faces of women are freely and fully visible, their hair flowing freely across their shoulders. In recent years, suddenly their hair is covered and the lower part of a niqab is at the ready to cover their faces.

Canada appears to be a sucker. Canada has swallowed what appears REALLY to be a very recent tool of 21st-century political-power manipulation, as if it is somehow some kind of eternal religious symbol.

I suspect that most Canadians do not like being played as suckers by the industry of political-power manipulation.."
"Yes some conservative voters are that stupid.   Yes some Democrat voters are that stupid as well.  Indpendents too.  

It will be interesting to see how voting goes.   Let's assume that people figure out what is in their best interest?    If you have a lot of discretionary spending money, great, this is going to reduce your price some because  low income sick people won't get offordable care.    These high earners tend to vote   (some would absolutely support single payer)

Then you have the lower incomes who have 3 choices: You accept higher payments; You accept  lower care levels/fewer visits; You don't have insurance.   Although you may be able to become poor enough to then qualify for medicaid.    These people tend not to vote.   

It will be interesting."
"Thank you, Sr Joan.  This election was devastating to me as an American, as a christian.  Devastating not only because a totally unqualified, uneducated in policy issues, con man manipulated voters by playing on their fears and prejudices, but also for what it says about what has happened to our country.  The ideals of America - the shining city on the hill, the ideals engraved on the Statue of Liberty (give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free) - are gone, destroyed by voters who chose a man whose statements and rhetoric are both un-christian and un-American.  America now turns its back on those who suffer.  Jesus said to love, not to hate. 

What has happened to the American people that they would choose such a man?  Hillary was very flawed in countless ways. But her flaws, weaknesses and even lies pale next to those of the man who was elected. His were beyond any normal political candidate - yet he won.  A demagogue.  I weep for our country."
"Nor do they mention the b j in chief BILLY..nor mention the criminal foundation they run...ask the people of Haiti how much they adore them...
The criminals that they are. Hillary stands by her men...bill and Harvey till...

"I believe it, but that's because I skipped a grade, graduated first in my class in college, and can remember that being a child didn't make me an imbecile. You?"
"Absolutely not....try reading it again.

I called no one a name. No one at all. I said the generalizations offered were unfair and inaccurate - and so they were. I said that was disgraceful. And so, in my opinion, it is.
Where did I call someone a name?

You however, on another thread, were very busy calling people trolls...presumably because you disagree with them. That, too - imho - is awful."
"This isn't just another ignorant attack on science, it's an attack on the world.  Donald has truly destroyed the US's reputation and credibility.  The world needs to put Donald in his place and move on.  This is sickening."

"I have not asked for ""tolerance"" to MY religion. You are wrong about the spelling of mo. It has been rendered in English in several ways. Insulting Christianity with ""fairy tales"" and false interpretations of what Christianity consists of is insulting Christianity. You insulted Christianity. I just pointed out the flaws in your history and interpretations. If you are muslim, and are ""consistent"" with the core beliefs as expressed in the Qu'ran, YOU hate Christians and Jews and atheists and esp homosexuals and condemn them to death. Otherwise, you have no scholarship with which to insult Christianity and support islam."
Iv personally been to one of his partys hes a fucking creep and i was kiked out for protecting a 16year old drunk girl that he was trying to have sex with. She left with me and i got her on a bus to some where else. Dude belongs in jail let alone on the sex offender registrie. He took advantage of girls like that pile of shit mayor did to little ass boys. Ask me he deserves to be locked up.
"What!?!?!?  Trump owes hundreds of millions of dollars - mostly to foreign banks, and has tons of business conflicts of interests.

Lawsuits have already been filed against him for violating US ethic laws

He's the dirtest president ever"
"""Ban on Muslim majority countries..."" Such a lie. Indonesia has the largest Muslim population on Earth, followed by Pakistan and  India. None of them are banned. Saudi Arabia neither... The administration has outlined these 7 countries as being a threat to the America, and is well within their right to close the borders to them temporarily. Where were all these SJW's in 2011 when Obama did the exact same thing to Iraq?"
Would give major props to Trudeau if he retaliated by giving notice to leave NAFTA. We are clearly dealing with a psychopath and we should strike first.
"`I can scarcely recall what I imagined the internet would bring when it bloomed a generation ago.

Nope. I did not see that coming."
"Thats a big boost to my confidence, if it can be proven that he has a mind.

Mind you, so far that has been very difficult task, as he seems to have forgotten most of his election promises.

Then there are those mis-spokes and elbow gate didnt do anything to his manners.

But, he is smart enough to get plenty of free holidays, so maybe there is some tiny tiny semblance of cognitive ability.

"As I watched the helecopter slowly make its way back into the valley through the rain and clouds (with the stretcher violently swinging underneath) I found myself holding my breath.  My thoughts immediately lept back to July 21, 1995 and I waited, for what seemed like hours, for the pilot to make his way back out.  I hope that young man realizes how lucky he his that the HFD pilots are so amazingly good and how being so stupid put more than just his life at risk."

"As Europeans have discovered, such muck-in integration is very difficult to do because of their faith. There are restrictions on what women can do and the men refuse often to work as equals with women. This makes integration into workplaces very difficult. There is a program on the TV in the UK where Muslims are placed in a house together. The disputes over sex roles are illuminating and show how difficult it is to reconcile this belief system with modern life. Some even express very violent views and wish to launch attacks. None of this is helpful for integration."
The staggering hypocrisy of liberal bigots is only exceeded by their shameless intellectual bankruptcy.
"Compared to the rest of the clown car cabinet, I will concede that he is something of an adult.  Nor does it even matter if he is an oil man.  The planet is doomed anyway.  Putin will doubtlessly give him another medal for helping things along."

$1250??!! Another number they pulled out of their arse.  Just another piece of the political corruption.  Also did we pay for the extra sessions held on the tax decisions for rail when they absolutely knew all along what they would be passing?  It was a big kabuki shibai act.  The fix was already in.

"The concept sounds fine.  Who hired the grade-schools dropouts who claimed they had engineering degrees to design and implement this scheme?  It should have been clear long before installation what the variance in wind velocity would be and how many calm days there would be.  Knowing the variance, it would be easy to determine if the local grid could accept the power on a really windy day.  Finally a reservoir only 5% of required size is inexcusable.  Looks like not a single solitary person actually ran the numbers before spending 65M euros.  Clearly a green politician with dreams of re-election was in charge.  Sound familiar?  I am skeptical enough of 'green power schemes"" - I do live in Ontario after all - but this makes the Ontario Liberals and their green buddies look like geniuses, and we know they are dumb as a bag of hammers."

"Talk about naïve, that would be you.  You seem to think it is acceptable for two people to have more wealth than 30% of Canadians; talk about sad.  We allow that!!!!  Not them.   And let me guess, you then go on to blame government and overspending.  Fact, people and corporations paid far more in the 30's up to the early 80's.   It is well documented their wealth was nowhere near as obscene as it is today.

An average CEO would make 10-15X the average employee, it is now in the USA about 350x, but to you that is acceptable for these job creators.  I am astonished literally astonished at how naïve your comment is.   The economic system is not real it is a man made construct.  A construct that is more and more manipulated by the very few.  Utterly astonishing people would agree with you and then not have any understanding how it affects them when they watch their wages stagnate and all they can do is attack government workers.  Pathetic."
"My niece wanted to go to Stanford. Like many young people, she was qualified. She also had several internships on her application courtesy of her step-mother's position as dean of biotechnology, so she got in while others didn't. 

While attending, and bombing at her first major, she met the love of her life. This young man is bright and talented, like my niece, but he majored in something silly. After graduating, he attempted to get into graduate school in computer programming, but was found wanting on his merits. Thanks to his step-mother-in-law, he was able to do a biotechnology training program and land a job at Genentech. While working there, he made the most of his talents and interests and is now doing computer programming, with an offer to have graduate school paid for while he works with admission guaranteed.

And that, friends, is white privilege. There are no black or Hispanic people who have those family connections that can make careers from whole cloth."
Perhaps some people on this page should enter politics...  seems fitting since the ignorance and blatant stupidity of comments would certainly guarantee a seat in provincial politics....

"How many innocent refugees would you give up to death, torture, rape, prosecution, etc. to save one other innocent local person from being raped? I mean, I recognise that there is always a potential for problems when accepting new people, but the attitude that ""our lives"" are so much more important than ""their lives"" is bewildering.

I get it if people are more attached to their own lives, or lives of friends and family, than to lives of a group of outsiders. But some girl a few towns away that I don't know, vs. some girl a few continents away that I don't know, I fail to see how one of them would be several (if not dozen) times more important to save than the other."

"Wow, Putin has the lying pig that's President of less than half of the US by the nuts!  Wild conspiracy theories are running through my mind.  A dead Russian hooker in a hotel suite?  A shady international business deal involving arms?  What could it be?  Trumps unwavering defense of a murderous thug is DEPLORABLE and INDEFENSIBLE!  Yet, his supporters continue to defend and make excuses.  At some point you'll have to just face it.

That's the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard. It is not the schools responsibility to raise children. Parents need to know what is going on in their children's lives and control who and where they are. If they would have had decent childhoods and no traumatic experiences with loving caring competent adults in their lives they wouldn't have done this.

"In order to arrest someone a suspected crime has to be committed.

Wrong. Muslim isn't a race so how can it be 'racist'? It is a lawful and appropriate  operating procedure that US CBP does secondary inspection on those born in or families from countries such as Pakistan or Saudi. In addition folks who are argumentative or jerks get the same treatment which is likely the case here.

"This is ridiculous. The Liberals have already said the point of this is to free up government funds to build other projects. IOW our taxes aren't going down and we're going to be paying user fees as well as taxes. Now they're desperate to find ways to justify it and claiming ""lower risk"". Right, because business will just shoulder the risk for us all and not charge for it. Apparently $30B deficits are not enough for Trudeau. This whole idea and the way it is being pushed is just insulting to Canadians."

"That the benefit would not be worth the cost is clear to any intelligent person, but we’re talking about a State that voted for Trump. Alaska is fast becoming the Appalachia of the north.  Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  
Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame."
"The players can kneel, as is their right. We, the fans, can criticize the players for kneeling. The players don't like being criticized, so they and the left claim it must be racism, even though white players would also be criticized. So the racial aspect is pure baloney. The players say they are not disrespecting the flag or the anthem, yet their actions SHOW everyone that is exactly what they are doing. If I go out on the field and start burning a flag but say I'm not disresrespecting it, is anyone going to believe me? Nope. Kaepernick said he would not honor the flag of a country that oppresses minorities and he started the whole thing. So this whole ""we are not disrespecting the flag"" is crap. Do the players really think what they are doing is going to solve all the racial problems of this country? That's just crazy and not what I watch the games for. I am so close to turning the games off and I love me some NFL. This is a loser for the players"

Dogs have caused thousands of deaths in the same time frame, Donald Trump is being exposed as a liar, racist, and possibly treasonous villain. Before people vilify and scapegoat wolves they too should understand the  facts and science and examine those  who use rhetoric and fear mongering to continue the irrational persecution and justifications to kill wolves under the guise of management or protection of livestock."

"Your pathetic defense and your usual ad hominem attacks aside I'll remind you about what happened to Senator Stevens.  Senator Stevens was prosecuted by career Democrat  prosecutors.  Why,  to clear the field for Mark Begich.  The left could not defeat Ted Stevens at the ballot box so they concocted the most ludicrous miscarriage of justice against a fine man.  The Judge in the case said that never in his life had he seen such an abuse of power.  Career Democrat prosecutors hid evidence,  allowed testimony they knew was untrue,  and presented false claims and falsified bills and valuations they concocted out of thin air.  That's how the left swings."
"Wow. Really? Trump keeps making idiotic statements about him. Is he just supposed to take it?

McCain is a war hero. He was a P.O.W.

Trump does not like war heroes that were captured. 
Trump is a draft dodger and a coward. 

Are you serious? You are defending the draft dodger?
Are you Vietnemese? A draft dodger? A communist?

I can not figure out why anyone would defend Trump’s idiotic attack on McCain. 
What is really incomprehensible to me is how anyone would defend a draft dodging coward.

Good luck with that. Why not go down to the VFW and tell every one that you support draft dodgers."

"As a physicist I can say things like:""Let us assume that the universe is one-dimensional"" or ""Let us assume that a solid has periodic boundary conditions"" and then derive in peace the consequences of my wild impossible assumptions.

But now a professor in the social sciences will have to be careful when he/she assumes that the humans or for that matter the chimps, are made of males and females.  A tiny fraction of the 1% of trans/etc... will go nuts and claim discrimination.

Gays won rights by claiming that nature made them the way they are but apparently we choose our gender.....  amazing how completely degenerate our Western societies have become."
"I think you are right. Once the beast operates, we're in for an unpleasant surprise. These legislators are clowns rewarding incompetence from the city. Who does that? We know they did."

You seem like the type who would forget to wipe and then complain and try to blame someone when you have a stream of brown running down your leg.  Take some responsibility for yourself don't blame others for your ignorance.
"A timely and well-written article.  Fundamentalist Christianity has always been a factor in right wing politics in the US, and while the creep factor is not as high as it is with a man like Bannon, is still something those not blindly aligned with the faith should be concerned about.

It strikes me as somewhat hypocritical that the far right rails against Islam as a force that could destroy the fabric of Western society.  While true that our society is largely founded on Judeo-Christian tradition, the views of Mr Graham are repugnant to many and pose a threat to our way of living.

In many cases, they should also be repugnant to those that embrace our spiritual heritage.  Love of enemies?    Forgiveness? Curiously absent.

When radical Muslims twist the teachings of their faith to justify abhorrent words and deeds, we vilify them.  Graham may not be guilty of abhorrent deeds but his words to the more tolerant among us are anathema."
"A technological culture that can hack into military ultra sophisticated digital fortresses can not produce a fake birth cert?  Are you nuts?  I guess a Manchurian Soros candidate is not possible either.  Right?  How can an

"Misinformation isn't conflicting. Among the experts who study these things for a living, there is no doubt about what's going on. 

Ken Hamm has a website and theme park dedicated to the theory of a 6000 year old earth, asserting that dinosaurs walked with man. That isn't conflicting with science because there's no science on Hamm's side of the argument. 

He has a bunch of junk studies and no real proof. Certainly no peer review... just like climate deniers."

Truly, trying to understand the leftist mind set is an exercise  in futility."
"Actually you wrote that no one was curious as to why Trump ""l-o-s-t"". Read your own stuff?
Okay, would ""abet"" be more precise? I really thought ""complicit"" was more respectful of those who voted for him believing that sexually assaulting women, general misogyny, vulgarity, vitriol, vengeful, rapaciously greedy, not paying taxes, stiffing workers and suppliers and investors were all matters of repentance and behavioral reform."
"THEY Pay? THEY pay for state government? They pay with OUR money from OUR resource, sport. They are the hired hands who bribed corrupt republican legislators and ended up with the keys to the ranch.

That is the standard speech from idiots and snowflakes.
"Trump is a piece of sh!t and hopefully he dies on the flight there of a heart attack. The vegas shooting is a perfect demonstration of the blighted hellscape republicans want to linflict on america.

Easy gun access means easy gun deaths, its a simple verifiable fact. Not to mention republican policies preventing a humane healthcare system from being deployed nation wide results in the survivors of that shooting begging for money online so they can afford to not have their lives further ruined.

With all dogs if you allow other dogs to push your dog around it will take the dominant role and follow its natural instincts. Dogs demand that there be a boss.

That is why when Ontario banned Pit Bulls the  ministers only comment was banned, banned, banned. He did not want to get into a stupid debate."
"Just more evidence that Canada is not a ""real"" country anyways. Not only that but just how has confederation benefitted Alberta? We've been net contributors to equalization since 1954 yet get ridiculed and berated for the development of our resources. We get called rednecks, hillillies and racists by the whole country yet they love to take our money. Tankers filled with crude from such upstanding countries as Algeria and Kazakhstan supply the East with her oil because the stuff Alberta has is too dirty ??? Hypocrites the lot of them and time for Alberta to go on her own. They love to see her lose and hate it when she wins. I'm so sick of it."

"Unfortunately, Sessions does not have the cajones to do the job in draining the swamp.  Too much the 
politician and not a straight shooter.  I felt this from the beginning in watching his press conferences.
He talked too much like he was still in the Senate and not someone who is supposed to be 
the US Attorney  General.  Wish Trump would nominate Trey Gowdy. Now there is a guy with balls of steel."
Sessions is already walking back his dumb comments on enforcement. I hope he's stupid enough to attack 29 states. Trump will eat that old man.

"China was never ever a market economy: it has always been a communist dictatorship. But global business was more than happy to move their factories there with dirt cheap labour and materials and a military regime to make sure there were no uppity unions, regulations of any kind and basically no taxes. We've been all been played for fools by business and by successive governments the world over and it takes an idiot like Trump to call it what it is."
"Yes, healthcare cuts ARE cuts, yes, they'll kill"
"Angela Merkel singlehandedly destroyed European civilization by welcoming hundreds of thousands of aggressive immigrants, who are  mostly without any usable qualifications, openly unwilling to do any work, with criminal and terrorist tendencies denied by or ignored by her thought police and represent an alien value system incompatible with European traditions. On top of that, she pulls the wool over peoples' eyes by declaring that she is doing it out of a deep humanistic impulse. 
If she is said to be  now the leader of the Free World, then there will be very little of this Free World left over after she exits.
 Trump may seem to be erratic but he does stand up for the ordinary working class Americans against the globalizers, the Rothchild and Bilberger oligarchs,and those who drummed up the climate issue for their own financial gain,and the easily bought pseudo-scientists to justify it.
The question is: who benefits from these politics. You must ask this first."

You, like Trump are scared little wimps who talk a big story but run to mommy when there's trouble.  Would love to see whiney little bitch Trump say SOB to an NFL players face.  You and your hero Trump are pathetic little babies."
"Well Gary, If being tired of the ignorance those on the left constantly display and being annoyed by the lies they propagate defines me as a 'bigot' so be it... I don't see a genuine reason to buy into the term. As far as being a racist - NOT a chance. Most of the liberals we are hearing from during this election and post election time are the true racists. It isn't a 'black or white' thing anymore, it's gone far beyond that. For the RECORD - I care about the 2nd amendment and so do millions of other people... The CRAP about women being 'second class citizens' is just that. Trump has a great track record towards women, do some research and actually check it out instead of believing all the left wing garbage. Of course there are racists across our country - I'm betting more on the left than right. Every time i debunk some crap a left wing nut posts they end up calling me names - including racist - they don't seem to like the truth for some reason so using the 'R' word is their defense."

"Jim Crawford you burn on the Governor, yet do not see the log in your own eye. Take a look at the tapes of the SB128 vote. Gleams in the eye all the way around less Charlie Huggins. No reason he wasn't there but no one asked, he ducked it, again. Yet, he's sniffing around for a Governor's run! Ridiculous!!! How about explaining your chief of staff Deb Grundman's absence Senator, get to it. Then Chenault sez: He doesn't have the votes for an override in special session. The monkeys out of the bottle. Alaskans have been had, bamboozled, run amok! I rightly guess legislators, former big guys like Crawford and the rest think everybody is just stupid. Tiring, very tiring."
"I don't agree. White people commit crimes just like black, samoan, asian, etc. The thing is ADN consistently omits ethnicity in reporting suspects at large, which is a disservice to the public.  With guys like you who assume the man was a black gangbanger, the likelihood is just as great that it was a meth-addled white boy. A sad commentary on your bias. What I am asking for is ADN to tell the whole story."
"There's always a few knuckleheads who have to go and ruin the fun for everyone else.

Here is a simple recommendation, allow the fun to continue but ban the use of floaties. Floaties are hugely detrimental to our environment and make party goers feel more secure than they are. It is not the canoe paddlers, SUP surfers, boat captains, or sailors which are the issue. It is the inexperienced and disrespectful ""floaters"" who are a menace and simple don't belong. 

I make my recommendation as someone who has participated in the ""floatilla"" many years but has always been appalled by the general idiocy and lack of respect for our oceans. 

Personally, I would support a perma-ban of floaties in Hawaii waters or at least Waikiki. They tend to encourages folks to get in ""over their heads"" in rapidly changing ocean conditions and create tons of trash."

One party state, so why should anyone with other inklings bother?

Even Dems, why should they bother when the same names get rehashed - a city council person can pop up agaon as a mayoral candidate then state legislator then federal legislator then back into a state office, then run some commission by appointment,  then back in the race for another office. ... who cares?

Video games that center around how many ways you can kill a person, advertised on television and targeting the youth and acceptable.  Television shows that show murder and are highly rated shows.

I saw this and said Yes, Yes, about damn time, this is what death is, they don't get up, they lay on the floor, they are dead, I'm not appalled, I have become numb.  The shooter was killed also, so you see him alive for the last time, does this appalled you?  I'm not sorry for my views, I'm so damn sick of killing, that if this what it takes to wake this country and world up, let see more of it.

"This is ignorant. The author has completely overlooked the issue of Native Land Rights. He doesn't speak for 'the rest of Canada' when he discusses politics, especially when he ignores the needs and rights of our First Peoples. By installing pipelines which damage historical landmarks and cut off food and water access in culturally important places, we further the colonial destruction of Indigenous history and cultural practice. Example: pipelines are cutting off water supplies to crucial areas of rivers, harming salmon populations, creating fewer opportunities for fishing (which has strong cultural significance), and lowering food supplies and incomes to Native communities.

It's despicable that white folks are often only concerned about the oil industry, and totally forget that there are industries (and entire cultural practices) being harmed by the pipelines, which will affect a lot more than 1, 800 people."

Stop pretending this is about keeping BC pristine or the environment. Your province has 10x more mines than Alberta, your #1 export is coal, and I didn't see you or any other BC hypocrite picketing to shut down Vancouver Harbour after that disgusting oil spill that I witnessed firsthand washing up not the shores of English Bay in 2015. You're prepared to rob your children and grandchildren of prosperity? Because you mention them in your post. Your anti-pipeline stance will do nothing but harm current and future generations by robbing them of $48 Billion. World oil use will not change by 0.0001% regardless if TM is built or not."

I asked several people that I caught on the wrong side of the tape, ""You just ducked under tape that says ""Police Line - Do Not Cross.  What do you expect me to do with this?  You DO realize that I could arrest you?"".

Canada needs a clearly defined national energy plan that incorporates both the exploitation /transportation of current reserves and a realistic transition to alternative energy over a realistic timeframe. This is easily a 20+ year process.

Sadly, too many of our local politicians, Premiers and Federal Government have zero idea what that looks like.  They love the tax revenue but they don't want to do anything for it. Their obstructionist backers don't either. In fact, they're the most useless of the bunch."

They don't leave the birth certificate blank on sex , waiting for a person to decide what fits their fancy down the road . It doesn't get any simpler than that. If your born a boy or girl , use that bathroom. Anyone who feels they were really born in the wrong body has issues .People with issues do odd things--like wanting to use the wrong bathroom. Letting people decide on a whim , what sex they are on that day--to use whatever bathroom they want is insane .We can't have men going in women's bathrooms with young girls and children in there. Just saying to trust people , who by they're very action have issues , is insane and dangerous . It's pathetic that some defend insanity ."

"Not all Republicans are white racists. However, the rest of the folks in the GOP are collaborators with the racists. They may be victims, but minorities are not the folks victimizing them. That would be the GOP elites that are laughing at them on their way to their off shore banks. I always thought it was insane to believe poor people are getting away with the money. Like Willie Sutton said when asked why he robs banks, that is where the money is. The GOP base of angry and resentful white people are too racists to follow the money. I would pity them if they didn't think killing minorities would solve their problems. Sadly, the Dems are too feckless to take advantage of the Republican racist dysfunction. They want to win back those Archie Bunker Democrats instead of turning out that rest of the American voters, like Obama did. They should let the GOP keep the racists and their collaborators.

On another site a person said that they love Trump now even though in the beginning they did not support him because he is not like all Republicans after Reagan and before Trump who would pee their pants if the press or the Democrats even said boo to them. I agree. Now it is the Dems who are peeing themselves.

"Where did I put the blame ""squarely on Ms. Azer""?

"Trump’s ‘Good Muslim, Bad Muslim’ False Divide

https://www.juancole.com/2017/06/trumps-muslim-divide.html

Trump defined whole groups of people as barbarians, and those who profit off the destruction and death of those people as civilized beacons of peace and goodness.
This isn’t some new, miraculously un-Islamophobic Trump. 

Just because his speechwriters know how to modify his word choice doesn’t change the hateful, violent, dangerous, anti-Muslim message that calls for the destruction of entire communities."
Make him worm.
"Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.

Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?"
This is just like the Presidential election where neither Trump or Clinton were qualified. Ice vs. Hanabusa is even worse.  Can't anybody come up with a decent candidate or all the politicians corrupt imbeciles?
"So it is just fine with you that some idiots burn down businesses, cars and other vehicles to engineer social change? Doesn't matter that many of those vehicles and businesses are minority owned?"
Trump is a walking pile pf garbage.  An awful President and human being.  Worthless in every way.
"I'm glad you find people being killed for nothing by fear-crazed police officers with trigger fingers funny.  I do not.   People should not have to be afraid that they'll be shot and killed simply because of the color of their skin, and the inability of a large number of incompetent law enforcement to control their anxiety and firearms.  Who wants a bunch of hyped-up, scared-of-their-own-shadows thugs in blue running around armed to the teeth?  At this point I'm much more concerned for my safety from the police than I am from any criminal. And no, I've never been arrested or incarcerated."
"When a person is murdered by a gun for some guns, you are damn right everybody needs to think about our gun culture. This shit is caused by that culture. And 18 year old lusted after those guns and threw his life away for guns. Did he really think he wouldn't be caught? Did he stop to think? Gun Fever...kinda like Buck Fever, only he didn't miss. The other beast human probably egged him on. You can bet they are flipping over each other in the cop shop."
"A terrorist is a terrorist, pure and simple.  Look the families in the eye who lost their loved ones over seas to end these bastards, and tell them that their child is dead, so that their killer can go free. Liberal logic at its finest."
"Digging deep for CONservative pundits?  Starr was, also, just forced to resign from Baylor University fat cat job for his part in the sexual predation and harassment scandals of the coaches and players on the football team.  Starr is nothing more than a Republican attack dog attempting to salvage the residue from the Republican traitorous attempts to overthrow the national governing system and all human rights contained therein.  His Clinton debacle was nothing more than a cash cow for himself and his lawyer buddies in the millions of dollars of taxpayer funds.  His incompetence as President of Baylor University was finally exposed for all to see.  Nothing this clown writes or says has any validity for anyone with brain.  Time for a Revolution."
"BLM= ""Pigs in a basket Fry them like bacon""

Sorry  I don't associate with terrorist groups from either side of the aisle."
"I was just saying that you made an allegation, and didn't back it up. Contributions I may or may not have made, nor any reactions I might give emoticons to are wholly irrelevant to the fact that YOU said something without supporting it.

Instead, you give an actual example of the Ad Hominem (abusive) -- attacking the person, not what the person said. But I have known for years that you aren't at all honest."
"Clown college math degrees aren't worth spit, Chris.

You're always overinflating Harper's total debt by $25-35 billion in your posts proving math is a challenge for you"
"After watching the love-in by the Republicans who went on and on as if it were a tea party asking Gorsuch about fly fishing and other idiotic nonsense (Ted Cruz looked like he was ready to swoon), it is obvious that none of these hearings are of any use whatsoever.  There are no winners at all, just a lot of American citizen losers - same with Trumpcare if it passes.  Marching bravely backward into the past .  SAD"
"As are most of his republican brethren, Don Young is a charlatan and a knuckle head."
"Before reading this post, I read the post with the theme that God's ways are not our ways.  Jesus was going to be killed, and he stopped Peter's attempts to change that.

I think Benedict's forced resignation and placing Francis as Pope was the sort of act that Jesus spoke against to Peter.  So the problematic acts of Francis are just the fruit of the initial bad act of driving Benedict out (likely by the homosexual mafia that apparently has great power and is using communion for divorced Catholics as a wedge to allow communion without repentance for homosexuals who commit sinful sex acts).

But, alas, I think we just have to sit back and let it all happen.  Perhaps the destruction of the Church through the infiltration of Satan is precisely God's plan.  The question is whether we should follow the fake Pope or reject him."

William Binney, who designed the American cyber espionage infrastructure, has said that the NSA had the capabilities to know exactly what hacking activity occurred and who was responsible.

"Yeah, 500 wounded, 59 dead and this is not the time to wonder when it is my turn , my families and friends turn to be out in and killed by one man from a hotel window on the upper floor story. Now if it was a Muslim terrorist who killed 59 Americans and shot up another 500 while praying to Allah and seeking all those virgins after he committed suicide you would be with the rest of the wingers and Trump saying ""I told you so""  and using this event for the biggest Ant-Muslim campaign since 9/11 and turn it on from all news media outlets and twitter before the bodies of the victims were even removed. In fact some right wing news media started on the Muslim terrorists attack when the event was still going on. They were hoping... it was not some old rich white since dude that does not play into their narrative."

Now to the story.  I was one of the few able to actually view the cameo before it was squashed, I assume by someone on Don's staff.  Don came across to me as a feeble minded old timer, looking for his sex pills.

Given a choice, I'd have to conclude that their form of insanity was far less harmful than that of the leaders of prominent atheist movements, such as Stalin.

The civilian body-count of officially secularist US wars from Korea through Afghanistan is CONSERVATIVELY estimated at ~ 6 million.

This in and of itself refutes the logical fallacy of attributing horrific wars to ""deist religion"".  At best it points to corrupt leaders' willingness to cloak their egregious VIOLATIONS of deist religions' authentic tenets with hypocritical facades predicated on them.  I don't exempt ""Muslims"" from this."

2- They made a big deal our of that fact and they continue to call the conservatives Nazi's.
3- They've been protesting the hate coming from the right (as white supremacists)
4- They, the left, attack a man because he's a Trump supporter
5- They attack him because he's wearing a MAGA hat and an Israeli flag...and he's conservative
6- They heckle him and tell him to ""get the F**k out""

It would appear the HATE is all on the left not the right. I don't agree with white supremacists or Nazi's or BLM for that matter. This country allows freedom of speech and the way one dresses is a form of speech, so allow it! The right has as much right to voice their opinion as the left does and no one has the right to attack the other just because they disagree with what's being said!"

The GOP leadership, and the Yahoos who enable it, instead chant, engage in tribalism, search frantically for ANYTHING (good or bad) that secures or enhances ""power"", and does it all based on dogmatic edicts from some insane, delusional prounouncements and directives from idiotic maniacs setting the GOP agenda.

Oppose it?  You're out of the tribe.  Counter the chants?  They chant louder.  Challenge the ""power"", and they counter with action to show they have ""more"".

Stupid."
EVentually the wall between the US and Cuba will fall. Trump would do well to be the one to do it. Obama abandoned the people of Cuba to continuing slavery which is despicable for a Black President.
"A 15 year old and a 19 year old. That is statutory rape! These losers want to throw their lives away so bad, then let them! They can kill each other. Saves us having to pay for their lawyers, medical, trial, court and jail just to have to worry about them being back on the streets!"
"What a joke.  I am going to round up some members of the Kalapuya tribe and come protest Wweek's ongoing use of a name appropriated from their ancestors.  The company should pay them back-royalties, and some pain and suffering for having to be reminded of the conquest of their people by the white man every time they pass a street corner and see the wweek box of papers.  This can't stand!

p.s. I wonder how many of these self centered, ""look at me, I'm protesting"" instagram pic posters who are at this ""rally"" gave even one shit about colonialism (as it is used to describe the negative aspects of british expansion, not food) before they got some alert of facebook from their ""activist"" group that a march was going to take place. Many probably still don't know a thing about it.   This is pathetic!"
Uh? Harper delivered 6 straight deficits including a record $56 billion in 2009-10. He lowered the HST lowered taxes and wiped out in no time flat a huge surplus he inherited from the Liberals. And Harper's deficits were on nothing not even infrastructure which Trudeau's is based on. As usual you CONS are complete idiots and haven't a clue.

"I'm sure that lots and lots of Republicans can't sleep at night because they realize that Trump will likely have to be removed - somehow. Either his resignation or death from natural causes is their fantasy - and mine. But neither is likely to happen. Impeachment will be used in efforts to get rid of him. Many Republicans face Congressional mid-term elections next fall and dozens of them are already very worried about their own political careers. The party has to make a choice between itself and the reckless, self-obsessed President. His  now-powerful and adamant followers will have to be politically discarded by the Republican Party. Messy, messy days ahead - leading to a Democrat majority in Congress next year and then a newly-elected Democrat President in 2020. Republicans are the dummies right now - and they are realizing it."

Don't bother with the ""fake news"" drivel; Trump makes a fool of himself every time he says it: why would you join him? Describing the observations of Gen. Honore and Mayor Cruz as ""uninformed"" is preposterous, dishonest. 
Interesting that you cite Russia in your attempt to whitewash Trump's failure in Puerto Rico: as the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election unfolds, nothing good is happening for Trump or for his surrogates.

"Definition of mob rule: control of a political situation by those outside the conventional or lawful realm, typically involving violence and intimidation.  Taken in context with the rest of your post referencing the ""hazards of tyranny,"" I would say I understand the intent of the phrase, ""mob rule.""   Are you comparing the peaceful march in Seattle to people hanging blacks from streetlights?  I'm not sure how you can draw any comparison between the two.  Women began fighting for the right to vote in 1848 when they started to organize nationally and convene women's conferences all over the US.  They organized parades, pickets and marches.  They were beaten, jailed and went on hunger strikes.  To suggest that after 72 years of fighting, women were given the right to vote because of the intellect of the Republican party is an ignorant conclusion that ignores the years of struggle and pressure women put on both the president and the congress."

That's pretty misleading  President Obama authorized rebuilding aging facilities where our current weapons are kept operational by performing maintenance and upgrades on existing weapons.

The administration, analysts and policy wonks, estimate expenditures on that program could cost a trillion over the span of 3 decades, though other sources say that amount of money probably won't ever be spent.

President Obama has kept the nuclear arsenal in the kind of shape needed to serve as a deterrent in today's world while continuing to reduce the total number of warheads as agreed upon by treaty.

With Rick Perry in charge of Energy (that's nuclear not oil), we're on very shaky ground.

This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?

Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?

Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.

Until you & others who voted for her hold to a higher standard there will be no meeting of the minds. What happened in this election was an anti-establishment thing. Congress barely changed. Governorships barely changed.  What did change was the election of a non-politican who defied both parties.

And you act out your inferiority complex by refusing to join in activities with other guests, complaining about the accommodation, and making offensive assumptions about your friends, their guests, and their parents. Hopefully your pals will wise up and realize that you're so much happier in the city and leave you there the next time they go to their home away from home. Oh and by the way, did they INVITE your dogs?"
"I concur, their comments above prove they are scum of the earth."
"Who is Bernstein that anyone should care what he says? Since when is a reporter a person we look to to evaluate our leaders? Wear Trump's shoes for week. Listen the insults and ignorance coming at him. Trump gets right in the gutter with the Left and they hate it. They want the gutter for themselves.

The Left entirely blames Bush for the last recession. It is a wicked lie. Bush did not initiate the policies that led to the crash, the Clinton admin and the Fed did. It is true that the foolish, irresponsible credit rules were supported by Bush, a few Republicans, all Democrats and the Fed. The Fed is mostly responsible for the recession. It is their Keynesian lunacy of growing debt bubbles instead of considering the productivity part of the equation. Everyone of us can live some good times on borrowed money, until the bill comes due. The Lenders followed the stupid, irresponsible rules created by Washington.  Washington, all of Washington, not just Bush was responsible."

Trump is a bold-faced liar and a pure-bred racist. He is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.

In that case, the black defendant got to live by testifying against the white bad guy, even though the black guy was the one who actually shoved the arrow into the victim's brain.  

And all just to steal the victim's car so all three of them could commit more bank robberies.  

And the black guy had gotten off on a previous murder charge in another State by testifying against the bad guy in that case, too."
"Instead of handing Bombardier's ""mismanagement team"" with huge taxpayer funded bonuses, Trudeau should have handed them a kick in the A$$ for disobeying his election mandate to ""help the middle class"" which, as it turns out, is actually secret code for getting elected on false promises and then robbing the taxpayer bank to fill the pockets of the wealthy.

2. Prices have not stabilized as you say, down -17% in Toronto in last 11 weeks. Some GTA towns are down 20 to 30%! That is called a correction and crash for some.

3. The new regulations will drastically impact house sales. It already has! Once OSFI  forces a 2% stress test on uninsured mortgages (80% of total), it will turn heads, Rising interest rates will also slow this down considerably. 

At least do some research before posting ridiculous comments!"
"Ungrateful bunch aren't they. Sort of reminiscent of Okinawa or the Philippines grumbling about our military presence. 
Guam should hold an island wide referendum and go with whatever the electorate wants. I'm all for independence for any territory that isn't happy with the US. Seems to me they have most of the benefits of being American and none of the bad things such as taxes. Voting matters little since they have so few people, they would less influence than Hawaii with it's 2 electoral votes.
Stupid people often don't realize what they've got until it's gone. They should go ask the Filipinos if they miss Subic naval or Clark air Force Base."

"Alice;
YOU were the ONLY ONE IN CHARGE!! You had the FINAL SAY on every story, on every line, and on every photo! You took a BUSINESS that was seeing already declining marketability, then you sought to  ""change Alaskan's point of view"" Instead you simply destroyed ADN's declining readership in typical ""charge ahead, we'll force them to see things OUR WAY"" ""Liberal Elites"" fashion... 

AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION you & your staff simply went completely NUTS, choosing to slam incoming President Elect Trump with every lie and rumor DEMOCRATS could possibly muster... doing so before the very ALASKAN'S WHO VOTED OVER OVERWHELMINGLY FOR OUR PRESIDENT!! 

And there is your constant DRUM BEAT of GLOBALIST POLICY & CLIMATE CHANGE!! Choosing to admonish ALASKAN'S who suffer like no others under OBAMA'S POLICIES just by their NEED to simply WORK TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES!! Shame on US for wanting HIGH PAYING JOBS extracting ALASKA'S RESOURCES!!

I just gota ask, ""How STUPID can you possibly be?"""

Well let's see if I were to conjure up new laws we would have no problem with these perps or other gangs. Just catch them and execute them on the spot. No need deportation as they probably will find their way back to America. My law would be no more gangs. You join you die.

He talks about the stupidity and evil of others but doesn't talk about the stupidity and evil of himself and his wife. Idiots who went into a war zone and exposed their children to horror and death. It is regrettable that these two have reproduced. At the very least Childrens Aid should take away their children. They are unfit to be parents.
Nope we're over the record now.  And good grief who the hell shoots someone in the face over marijuana.  Wtf is wrong with them.  Plus 4 people are going to go down for a murder they only witnessed? But the shooter is still free? Screw that! Someone needs to get the shooter in there with them.

Just remember that republicans didn't always stick with Nixon."

"Trump's  main negative is his seemingly on-going, ill-considered comments.  I hope he can get a grip on that.
But his positives are: 1. he is nationalistic -proU.S., 2. he will build the wall 3. he will restrict muslim immigration & muslim influence in general 4. he will demand that other countries pay for U.S. military protection 5. he will get tuff with foreign aid to countries that oppose us 6. he will make trade deals that favor US employment and trade balances 7. he does not participate in PC. 8. he will end Obamacare 9 he terrifies both Dem & Rep. establishments, both of which have become corrupt. 10. he will see that B.O. & his gang of muslim/socialist miscreants are investigated -prosecuted if such is warranted.There are more positives with this American. So, I'm for TRUMP, he clearly trumps the rest."
"Why should he have to take the supposed high road?  Trump started this with his nonsense and abrasive nature:

""...“He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”...""

Who the heck is Trump to talk?  I can't defend a draft dodger....no matter the war.  I joined and honorably served even though I knew the wars we've had since WWII are largely unjust.  But, I served just the same as a way of thanking this country for the Constitution and the freedoms it gives us.  All Trump did was avoid serving with all of his effort.  Friggin' coward!"
"The ""Russia,Russia.Russia"" fiasco is getting really ""old, old, old"". The Demoncrats and the MSM have found NOTHING, because no crime has been committed. Even Jr's indiscretion is not a crime. I am sick of hearing the inane, moronic comments from the idiots and losers in the MSM. It is time to move on and support PRESIDENT TRUMP's agenda. In spite of the jackals in the MSM, the Dims, and the RINOs, he has made great progress in meeting his campaign promises.

The Demoncrats will get their fair reward when the Republicans gain another 20 Congressional seats in 2018.

PRESIDENT TRUMP - MAGA - Today & 202!!"

Complete idiot? Maybe! But he sure aint doing anything for the State he represents!
Your comment of Obama and turd in the same sentence says it all about the last eight years. A few more weeks and you can flush twice and close the toilet lid on the last pathetic decade!
People who post anonymously and then complain about their posts being censored is hypocrisy.
"Trump is everything the left hates, a wealthy heterosexual white male, whose wealth was partly acquired through inheritance. To them he is the big bellied southern sheriff and they are the brave freedom riders. This is the romantic philosophy they have been taught and cling to and protest is part of this romance. If this writer wanted to protest something, maybe she could start a campaign to find out why there are so few writers of colour (I hope that is the right word) on the Globe staff. Maybe she could mentor a disabled African Canadian woman, help raise her up from nothing and as a culminating act of sanctimonious goodness offer her your job."
To Alberta moron?
In serious need of an injection to put it to sleep forever.
"I never said that women priests meant there should be no married priests.  The order in which this takes place represents a concern for the human dignity of all women.

If our church ordains married men then WE THE People are claiming that we believe women are less sacred, less important & less human than men & not deserving of equal spiritual rites & sacraments or any voice at all.  

Right now we have a small portion of celibate men ruling over all other men and women.  Deacons are a joke who have no authority.  Men were served no injustice - it is not injustice to demand celibacy.  

We must ordain women first or at the same time as married people or we create an abuse against the dignity of all women that is so severe as we have never committed its like in our entire church history.  

This is a test of what we-laity will allow, as far as, the abuse of women in our church, if Francis puts it thru.  We must demand these men stand up against sexism 1st to show worth for priesthood."
"Describing ""the most dangerous place on Earth"" as a polling booth is saying that if you vote a certain way, great harm will follow. Using that kind of logic, the most dangerous place on earth would be somewhere that current behavior is sure to cause future disaster. The $19 trillion national debt comes to mind. Or the lockup of mining and manufacturing by the EPA. Or the moral collapse of the family. Or the stupidity of the American public school system."
"By a very large margin, the worst crimes, terror attacks in the US, domestic or otherwise, are committed by right-wing white people..."
"Here's the difference: Even a peaceful protest by the white supremacy crowd still signifies racism and even some aggressive racism.  A peaceful protest by the opposition signifies living together in equality and peace.  At its core, white supremacists are arguably the root-cause of the issue.

Sure, we should be able to know this without having to be told so, and accept that any violence is bad.  But, pointing out the root-cause, which is exactly the white supremacists, definitely has merit.  

Trump a man?  Pfft.  More like a draft dodger."

And I for one am glad they did.BUT, if the Russians did do it, Im would be angry they involved them selves with the election, but all that happened was actual EMAILS were released that showed Clinton and her cronies for the scum dogs they are. There was no manipulation of truth or votes, Just information dissemination. We as a nation are a better place for it.

Your pretend outrage is just more of you constant attack on anything that would distract from the progressive agenda."
"It's interesting that the RG doesn't see the connection between this and the alt left mob protests in Eugene.

"The Second Amendment doesn't mention guns, firearms, or any other weapon specifically. It mentions arms, and qualifies the right to keep and use them to only a ""well regulated militia"". Currently the Supreme Court has ruled that means that municipalities don't have the right to ban use of firearms by citizens, a right that was taken for granted for a hundred years. A future Supreme Court could overturn al prior interpretations, just as the Roberts court did. Any right can be qualified, as the First Amendment has been. The majority of US citizens would go along with strict limits on possession and use of firearms. At some point this will have to happen. The NRA is really screwing up by opposing all restrictions. The NRA should be working toward sensible regulation that would reduce gun deaths and save honest competent gun owners from outright confiscation. The ""cold, dead hand"" death fantasy is truly stupid."
get rid of all the illegal criminals and maybe you might have some money.
"You don't know that, you were not there.  What we know is that there is NO EVIDENCE whatsoever.  Your Alynskite response says more about you than him.  Instead of calling him names why don't you stop being such a hypocrite.  Your words:  racist, dishonest, disgrace, etc.  That defines you, not him.  Sessions came off the winner here, and people that tried to call him names like this just look foolish.  The dems are foolish.  Everyone is laughing at them after Sessions put them in their place."

Trump kicks ass! Christine Flowers is just another misguided blowhard who thinks she knows what's best for the country.  A liberal socialist leftwing whack job who simply refuses to admit that Obama was the one who signed this legislation into law while Trump is the one who enforces it.

Dumbest comment of the month.
"half this country heard the warning about the really bad brown acid going around and decided to forgo food and live on the brown acid instead, now with Trump's success in conning the gullible, vulnerable, angry, and confused, we see the end results of that mass stupidity as we all stumble down the path of no return.

many of us had a 50+ year run of incredible fun despite the hurricane of increasing insanity swirling around us post WW2 when this country paid in buckets of blood to stop those who behaved like Trump, and now we've come to the end of the bumpy ride as we sail off the edge of an easily avoidable cliff into an unknown abyss..."

No more money or aid. Maybe NK people will rise up and take him out. He will kill them anyway with his warlord mentality."
"Another glaring example of elected officials preferring backroom, secret interrogations to the public's right to know.  Will there be a written record of the meeting?

He should refuse to participate in any such political ploys by the cowards currently occupying and violating their seats and oaths of office.  Disgusting."
"The increases in our real estate valuations have been ridiculous, and benefit no one unless they are leveraging the asset, or selling and leaving. The only thing I got for a 44% increase in value, was a higher tax bill. Several BC Liberals hold multiple properties, and cannot have helped but make a profit. It would explain the unwillingness to admit there was a problem to begin with, the repeated claims of not wanting to negatively affect property values that had climbed beyond reason, and the delay in implementing any measures to address the issue."

He emboldens and encourages virulent racists like butinski to say this kind of stuff.

Was this Trump's intent?  Possibly.  It's consistent with his other race baiting statements.  

Or, was it something he did not realize would lead to this?  Possibly also, because Trump is an idiot."

Again, its the big pharma lobby groups that get the sweetheart deals from governments so they can make huge profits on theses drugs.  The government didnt do it to encourage companies to develop treatment for rare diseases.  big pharma goes to where there is easy money to be made.  This is how they can take university studies and trials and profit on it.  You are naive or work for big pharma if you continue to regurgitate the notion that these ridiculous treatment costs are necessary for these treatments to be developed.  This story even shows how the treatment for HTT was a complete fluke.  They had to go find a disease in a text book that would respond to the research.  Now they want the governments to shell out 1 million a year for treatment.  Big Pharma lobby makes governments look incompetant"

"No they aren't, the United States is our largest trading partner, we just don't call it exports.
As to what goes to China, over 97% of the value of the minerals and ores that go there are reaped by the Chinese.
We get less than 3 cents on the dollar for it's dollar value.
I'd say we're getting taken to the cleaners now, why would we want to do more of that?
That's dumb.
You could benefit from going back to school, I'm sure continuing education is offered in your neighborhood.
Maybe you'd learn the value of our resources and not want to give them away so foreigners profit from them.
We should be profiting from the value, not giving it away for little or nothing,
As I said before, that's dumb.
We do that with oil, give it away for little or nothing, and that's dumb,
….why do that with gas too?
Dumb.
Would you give them 97 cents from every dollar of your savings? 

Reducing your net worth by 97%?
Sounds like you might."

And in epoch fashion, you failed.  I note that you didn't bring up a gay nightclub in Orlando, which also, according to you, isn't as safe as Little Mexico.  Are gay nightclubs awful?"

"See.....you are not being ""rational and compassionate"" - or factual.

I am NOT a ""holier than thou"" one-issue obsessed Catholic,' nor am I the one being a bully.  I have NEVER demonized ""pathetic women"" in fact, I work with them and listen to them.  Nor am I using ""nasty inflammatory language"" - nor is it I who now look like a ""sadistic sexist, insecure, schoolyard"" bully.

Did you read YOUR comment?"
"Yes, some women can be more careful.  Men can also do more to make sure that women who drink too much aren't taken advantage of.  If women thought they were going to be raped they wouldn't have walked down that alley or went to that party, or gone to a bar, or a friend's house.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  Since we are using cliche's.   

But we've all made mistakes.  Some people have addictions and other problems that make them more prone to being victims.  Others are practiced perpetrators who know exactly how to find their victims.  The problem is why is it OK for men to get shit-faced drunk and women not to?  
Men need to step up and take responsibility.  It is rarely women who rape."

"You are a crazed optimist. Go to any provincial courthouse in the country on criminal arraignment days. Look at the case list. Probably three-quarters of the cases on the list could be summarily described as ""got drunk, did something stupid"". Alcohol contributes to most of the crime in this country.

Also, between smuggled untaxed cigarettes and burglaries with the object of stealing cigarettes, there's quite a lot of tobacco related crime."

"Wow, what an absolute pathetic country we live in. We are a resourced based economy which should have very little unemployment and no government debt if we didn't have such dim witted politicians and voters wanting us to be something we are not. Between delayed and cancelled energy projects, LNG, pipelines, Ring of Fire to name a couple. Could have been a pioneer for LNG but now the US and Australia own that market. Develop nothing, become more unproductive tax the hell out of the citizens at every turn. We are closer by the day to becoming a socialist society the liberals so desire us to be.

99% of  all terrorist are Muslim.  But the other Muslims dont want to face that very clear and simple truth.   There is tacit acceptance and even veiled approval in their refusal  to admit it.  Allah Akbar and Inshallah are all important.
"Jenifer; What those in the Hierarchy fail to understand is how many Catholics have either left the Church or if still there refuse to contribute financially because of their handling of the sex abuse crisis. Cardinal Dolan, of New York was recently heard complaining that Catholics are not contributing enough. There has been some training for those who work in the Church. That training has been targeted on lay people who work there and not on clergy and especially not on Bishops. Their financial problems are self made. If they were to recognize the abuse, admit to how bad it was/is and that they purposely covered it up,  many of their financial difficulties would eventually go away. But that would take leadership. Something tremendously lacking in the Catholic Church."

"Oh baloney. You think those are union men, and that Trump would have paraded out union men? Do you have proof they are descendants, or that they even know about the mine strikes? Those men think their jobs are coming back because that's what Trump literally told them and all America.

Hillary didn't take away the coal jobs, nor did Obama. What took those jobs away was the far cheaper and cleaner, abundant natural gas from fracked wells in the USA. And right now, China is switching to solar and wind. eating our lunch in the Pacific Rim after Trump ditched the TPP. Talk about dumb and dumber.

I know about union strikes and corporate murder of strikers. I've even posted here about some of that. And I don't need any coal miners among my ancestors to know about that."

Deservedly, Trump isn't going to do Zoolander any favors for his trashing during the election.

Zoolander only helped escalate our problem with his moronic jabs.

"And they can be taken to task for it as Republican President Ford was when he pardoned Nixon.  Of course at that time voters were more ethical, moral and sane, recognized corruption, and so vote lost his re-election bid. Now we have Trump's base, a constituency that doesn't know what those words mean and could care less that Trump is at best a corrupt loser and at worse a traitor."

"How could you possibly know if someone is practicing sodomy? Just because a same-sex couple comes for communion, it doesn't mean you can tell if they're  having sex, any more than you can tell if an opposite-sex couple is using contraception. All you know about either couple is that they are in love and they want to share their blessed relationship with Jesus. How can sharing your relationship with each other and with Christ mislead the faithful?"
What a joke. This guy is an idiot. How on earth does it make sense to punish those that have jobs just so you can keep supporting the entitlement community? MORE CUTS!!!!

"Tulsi only disagreed with the President's foreign policy on Syria, TPP and DARK Act. Obama's not so small-minded that that would ruin their Aloha for each other. President Obama and Trump get along just fine, if you haven't read. Clinton, too - they went to his wedding in 2005.

"I grew up in a conservative Midwestern family, but reading articles like this over the years and hearing the conservative stance on issues, describe why I lean left. The articles, which portray the conservative/Republican mentality, are often asinine, mildly offensive, unprofessional, absolutely ignorant on core issues, and written from an accusation stand point. Conservative slants in America are among the most ignorant on the planet and their rhetoric easily gives themselves away. Trump is another great example of this which is why his presidential legacy has started to become stained in under 100 days. It isn't the blame of Democrats, and liberals, immigrants, African Americans, or poor people. Those are just scapegoats. Republicans and conservatives are, just as much or if not more, a major part of the problem with the current political climate in America. Their denial of climate change is another example. It also isn't just ""government that's the problem"" Again, It's themselves."

"The crumbling ""bricks"" that make up the rest of the wall are the voters who support him.  It's criminal that if you take away the racists, misogynists and the too stupid to breath if they had to think to do it you're left with a core of economically destroyed people harboring legitimate anger but who can't bring themselves to blame Republicans for creating a political imperative that ""greed is good"".  At the same time they only see the DINOs' in the Democratic Party who either ignored them or voted with Republicans to screw them.
Even when Obama had a first term mandate and a Democratic Congress he failed to break the power of Wall Street, failed to break up too big to fail banks, failed to kill corporate controlled trade agreements under negotiation and squandered his power on the ACA in which he failed to demand single payer instead invited Republicans and health insurance companies to help write the reform bill.

First thing is to vote that crook of a Governor out of office along with the other LIARS down there in Juneau that are just throwing money around like its water. I saw a case the other day, the state sent a package with documents to another state office via UPS next day. What would of been wrong with someone taking that package/documents over to the office?? The cost would of been a Hell of  a lot less then UPS Next Day delivery. This was also done in the city of Anchorage. No thought put into a very simple cheap way to get something delivered.

"Sorry, I was not calling you a hypocrite, i am saying the attitude in general is hypocritical.  words, actions or attitude can be hypocritical
I agree the discrimination and racism and all that crap got to go. But I have a problem when I see people that say they are victimized against (in various ways), then turn around and do the same exact thing to someone else - and then attempt to justify their actions.  Or on a different angle, when the police are trying to uphold the laws, then the police themselves screw it up royally and break the very laws they are supposed to uphold.  Yes, shootings of unarmed people on the top of that list, and it has happened here in Hawaii numerous times.

I am curious though about your views on ""the superior white man situation.""  Just because someone complains, does not mean they think themselves superior, Make sure you are not ""projecting"" on them what you assume they think.

As a business man, I was horrified that it took our country over 220 years to build a 9-10 Trillion Dollar debt and Obama added ANOTHER 4.5 Trillion in only 4 years. Then another four it was doubled.  But I voted against him the second term, to no avail and the detriment of America.  Your incredibly racist and biased posts astound me. Playing the race card is your only ""move"". And Obama WAS a traitor. He should have been impeached."

"This is the downside of accepting Muslim immigrants.

Nothing is easy and comes without problems folks."
"We are a culture of high-seekers and substance abusers. Kids hear adults basically telling them, ""Pot is harmless,"" or worse, even healthy for them. Cultural and media messaging is powerful stuff. Think Big Tobacco, and how pervasive that addiction was in the 1960s. It was okay to smoke while pregnant, in planes trains and automobiles, in supermarkets, everywhere. It's not a contest. Pot is not ""safe"" but pundits say it's safer than alcohol, which is only a partial truth. But the point is more that a vice is a vice, and adults are promoting another vice in pakalolo. My kid at first believed his peers doing drugs were stupid, but now after we talked about it, and he did some reading, he concluded that adults are way more stupid because they should know better, and are ultimately the real reason that kids start using. He came to that on his own. I like my child. He's astute."
"Impossible to discern what point authors like Mr. Saunders and his ilk are trying to make anymore. They asserted constantly that the US has lost any moral authority as a country of leadership and that they are the laughing stock of the planet. Trump is a bamboozling cretin not to be trusted surrounded by sycopants.

Lets talk about the real bullies. Those corrupt leaders of foreign countries, like Mexico and drug lords that create intolerable conditions where people think it is best that they flee north to America. Lets speak of the millions of bullies that illegally enter America, some who murder, rape and commit millions of serious and petty crimes throughout my country. Lets talk about the extortion on the part of the government that takes the hard earned wealth of some and squanders  it through  gross overspending and taxation, in the name of justice when the real motives are political and having to do with increasing the number of people who will vote for the Progressive cause. How about these bullies. Does anyone truly think that Democrats or kindred Republicans care about the aliens who come here? If they did care they would not be assuming that all of the problems in S. America can be solved by sending people to America. This solves nothing."
"Like most democrats he is desperate to spin the story in his favor.  Hard to argue with facts.  This guy should never have been let into the USA ... yet liberal immigration policies see Canada ands the USA and all of Europe being flooded with religious zealots who will never integrate into our society.  

Immigration can only maintain the confidence of the populace if you properly extreme vet and only allow in people who make the country better.   The absolute test must be ""does this persons presence make Canada (or other jurisdiction) a better place than it is without them""?

Unfortunately the answer is often a no ... and we let them in anyways ... and then act surprised when they slaughter our citizenry or abuse our social safety nets or spread their religious hatred to others.

Indeed, Vancouver is ranked the third least affordable housing city in the world (behind Hong Kong and Sydney).

They actually did good, unlike Trump and all of his fake charities etc.  There is no equivalency, period. Trump is a criminal, a crook, whatever you want to call him. And he's one not because some nameless schmo in his organization got sticky fingers, he's a crook because he's the one with the sticky fingers. Not that he'd ever rightfully point them at himself, no.  He'd throw his own kids under the bus before owning what he does."

A classy, decent, well brought up gentleman would have waited for the first commercial break and quietly told Larry he had bad breath. Not Trump. He didn't even have the decency to shake out a few Tic Tacs for old Larry. Guess T rump reserves those for sexual assaults."

"I would say I'm using ""nobody"" and ""everybody"" colloquially and pretty much literally. Yes, I am being righteous. I spent 10 years watching DanceHer. I had friends giggle while they talked about he ""wouldn't take no for an answer"" or how ""if he decided he wanted to fuck you, that was pretty much it. He'd fuck you."" I had other male friends discuss how he was the ""perfect gateway or finishing school"" for young women to enter into the Seattle hippie community. 
That's only perfect if your ideal woman has been sexually traumatized and has difficulty asserting her boundaries. I had a trusted male friend tell me if I chose to engage with DanceHer, none of my boundaries would be respected. Condoms would not be used. My preference for sober sex would not be permitted to happen. 
I had young men come up to me and tell me how ""amazing"" DanceHer was. I would respond with, ""Hmmmm...yeah, he's a sexual predator."" They'd look at me in shock and wonder why I was being so mean-spirited."

Best ship the tar safely in steam heated rail - at least the cars can be reused.

What the Mr T doesn't get is that nuclear power starting in Asia, will be killing fossil fuels flat out.

I do not understand why he keeps getting elected but, he is who he is.  I don't  blame Dan Sullivan.  He is an empty suit elected by $20 million in Koch backed funding.  He votes his corporate agenda.  I do have a really hard time with Lisa Murkowski.  Political pandering on Betsy Devos aside, she votes lock step with Koch and ALEC and the far right.  She was elected by Alaska Natives and moderates.  She just voted for Jeff Sessions for AG.  Sessions is a racist.  I wonder how that sits with her Native constituents.  Shame. Shame. Shame.

"The point you make about the statement ""When he got shot I was"" also causes me to cringe or get ill or feel disgusted. I notice so often that people will make the statement as if it ""happened"" rather than saying ""I did this."" I am sure I've used the same type wording on occasion since I'm human. It's disconcerting when I hear others do the same. I hope the kid will someday say ""When I shot him...."" When I say I did something I am able to internalize the act. It becomes about my responsibility rather than something outside myself. I'm able to heal & hopefully help others involved heal as well, if that's possible. All these kids will be impacted for the rest of their lives. I hope kids will learn from it.

"Oh Kathleen, as a member of the media, you too want the candidates to play the game your way.  If it comes down to Trump vs Clinton, I'll probably go for Trump.  Clinton is in my book a glad hander who will say what voters want to hear, but will do that which most suits her rich woman needs.  Her real friends are not poor blacks, but the rich and powerful.  Trump at least is willing to take on the media's notions of political correctness.  Underneath all his bravado and slogans, Trump probably has some brains.  I don't sense that he is evil.  Sans evil and having brains, what would he do if elected.  I would like to hear the media ask him about his views on American interventionist wars.  About his views on prison reform and mandatory sentences.  About the drug war.  About funding social security.

"If this is just another crazy gunman, as opposed to an act of terror or hate-crime, then I'm not saying anything about it except to say that if Americans can't enact sensible gun laws then basically they don't really care about these mass-shootings very much.

So why the hell should anyone else care?

There is a difference between a common-or-garden American mass-shooting versus a hate-crime or act of terrorism. 

I care more if it's a hate-crime or act of terror.

A common-or-garden mass-shooting in USA is a problem due to non-existent or insane lax gun-controls and the crazy gun-culture in America more than anything else, including mental-health. These mass-shootings are inevitable in a society full of guns. Since Americans don't seem to care about proper gun-control, I therefore have little sympathy, apart from for the people directly affected, when this happens in America. It's their own goddamn fault."

What an attitude. Oh, there are conservatives coast to coast to coast as seen during the Harper era. Alberta is very diverse now - we have people from across Canada and the world. When you smear Alberta, your smear may be against people from your own home province who came to Alberta for ""work"" and live well.

It is time to look at unions in Canada. Do certified professions like teachers, nurses and other public service professionals need unionism? No. The government can set a sliding wage scale and increased pay should just not equate with how many hours/years on the job but the QUALITY of the work - just like in the private sector. Occupations that don't require specialized education need unions to protect worker rights.

His one-read-and-run approach to QBing doesn't work. RG3 plays the same way and is unemployed, yet I haven't come across any articles claiming RG3 is being 'blackballed' by the NFL. Third, he chose to use his workplace to be politically active. He wore the Castro shirt and the cops as pigs socks. He made his statements and was well within his rights to do so... just like the NFL owners are well within their rights not to employ him. He will land with a team eventually, I'm just glad it won't be in Denver."

"You are the one who is lost here.  No President or congress has [or will] change that law.    Secondly, I was not referring to Charles Curran----Brian Johnstone wrote that essay.

Johnstone demonstrated that during the pontificates of JP II and Benedict---a profound shift moved from Gaudiem et spes which saw the consciences of Christians as often ignorant, but it was an inculpable ignorance.  Ratzinger saw Christians as often ignorant, but culpably so.

Johnstone, ""Conscience in Error,"" in CONSCIENCE: READINGS IN MORAL THEOLOGY 14, ed. Charles Curran [Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 2004], p. 169.

Ratzinger's critique of conscience fails to distinguish between the primary and secondary precepts of moral law.  It fails to recognize or entertain the complexity of markedly different cultural contexts.  Ratzinger, who had a limited pastoral experience as young priest---assumed far too quickly that people are guilty for not knowing the moral law, when in fact, they may be inculpably unaware."

"You're right, SB, so long as the bunch of cheap socialists aren't so stupid as to tweet that all those who call themselves refugees from anywhere in the world are  welcome to come to their country and then hundreds or thousands of phony refugees from the Muslim world begin flocking illegally across their border, up to half with criminal records, and the national police respond by helping them with their luggage.

But since nobody could possibly be stupid enough to cause this to happen, then the US has nothing to worry about.

Mind you, the potential upside for the US in this insanity is that most of the bad guys coming here in this refugee tide are coming from the US so we are thereby helping them get rid of their potential Jihadists.

Unless, of course, they just use Canada as a staging ground to plan and prepare for strikes on US soil."

"I started posting here because I needed to say my horrors about the Catholic Institution clergy’s sex abuses of children.  I am one of those mothers who suffer through family member’s the devilish suffering from rape for twenty years.  For me, I am not sure if a child horrendous suffering from rape is more horrible or the CI (Catholic Institution) clergies continuing betrayal of hiding and condoning clergy sex abuse of children is more horrible.    
So the most of my posts are quite negative.  My overall sentiment is ‘over my dead body any of you clergies will rape children and get away with it’!!!   
Either CI will reform or it will die.  No matter what it will be better than the way it is now, since right now we are worshipping more of ‘d*vil’ with ‘d*vil’.   I sense CI is already too corrupt to reform.

"Mr Summers:  You are living proof that we are in an era when the message is irrelevant.  All that matters is the messenger.

The same is true of left-wingers.  It does not matter the message.  It does not matter if it's the same message from both sides.  It's so much easier to claim the person is a stupid head than to actually think.  Thinking is hard."

Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

However, it's these same idiot lawyers on the government payroll who were probably too lazy/incompetent to negotiate with Mr. Khadr's lawyers for a lower sum of money.  By rewarding Mr. Khadr $10.5 million, we've just sent a message to all terrorists and any radicals within Canada that it's financially worthwhile for them to take up arms against their own country.  Sorry, but we need to refresh the entire Ministry of Justice to get in some decent lawyers who can actually debate based on facts."

""Bullshitting isn't exactly lying. A liar flatly denies the truth of something. A bullshitter obfuscates the truth for his own benefit. When a liar is caught stealing a candy bar from the corner store, he will swear up and down he didn’t do it. When a bullshitter is caught doing the same thing, he will try to cloud the issue. Maybe by saying the theft of one measly candy bar is nothing compared to the vast sums the government steals every year through punitive taxation. Or maybe by observing that the store is run by dirty immigrants.""

So he told the Post family that he'd bought the property between the M-a-L and the ocean and was planning to build something hideous there, thus destroying the view. He got the property for $7 mill.

"I adamantly disagree that Congress has been delegated some kind of Constitutional power under the Amendments that affords it to require Americans to travel between the states, under any conditions. And, with all due respect, our courts are so corrupt that they're rulings at times are nonsense."
"Nothing new here. Obscene sexual grooming took place at a top model C school in Cape Town for years and the W. Cape education department made sure it was never aired, while the chairman of the school governing body, a supposedly respected lawyer, was pleased to announce re the complaint that ""I think we've made it go away"". Sickening hypocrisy."

"Since my phone has a calculator, I don't even need basic math skills. If I feel sick, I go to the doctor and say ""I hurt here and feel hot."" That excludes me from needing physiology.

I can't draw and can't play any musical instrument, so those classes were wasted on me as well. ""When I look back on all the crap I learned in high school..."""
"Rep. Eastman says stupid things. The question is, does he say them because he believes his constituents will support him for doing so...or does he actually believe what he says. Either way is strange...but I fear he actually believes his own stuff. And yes, some of his constituents eat this stuff up."
"I have never envied the rich.  I have enough money to do what I want to do from hard work and saving...I’m sure that 95% of them gained their wealth the same way.  I do despise the lazy, arrogant poor who do nothing and those who bitch about the rich having “too much” money...screw ‘em!"
"Allegation = A claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically one made without proof.  The headline reads ""allegations"".  Even if they are guilty you need to prove it in court.  Talk about a lynch mob.  Why not just skip the trial.   All those that had Kenoi convicted before trial raise your hands.  That's right, easy to talk crap but difficult to prove in a court of law.  Relax and let due process take it's course before dealing out punishment so you won't look so foolish if people are found innocent of the ""allegations""."
"What nonsense.

This article is a prime example of why intelligent people should not trust financial advisors. I have a PhD from the top rated public university in the United States. I may not be the smartest person in the world but I do think I'm no dummy. When an investment article has even one line in it that makes me think ""how stupid does this person really think I am,"" it leads me to find the entire article disreputable. Unfortunately, The comments section does not permit me the space to adequately explain my comment. If the author wants to hear it, he can reach me via my profile."
"“You shouldn’t run out in front of cars on the interstate or the highway and attempt to illegally protest. If you do, it should be at your risk, not at the risk of the liability of those individuals driving down the road.”
.
Speaking as a liberal, I AGREE! Stop blocking the damn interstate. Having said that, I see no reason for a new law. It should already be the fault of the people blocking the roadway if they get hit accidentally. And as the story above indicates, a law specifically addressing would be interpreted by some as a license to kill by some."
"Resistance is not futile!

Perriello expresses the same typical lame punditry we have been hearing from FOXNews that have lead to handing over our national government to the political equivalent of the KKK.  Twitler is a treasonous Russian puppet - just like Hillary Clinton told us.  There is no compromise with these twisted, demented people.

Democrats are not fighting for themselves but for our very democracy.  As Americans have learned ever since the Minute Men stood their ground at the North Bridge in Lexington, freedom is not free.  A lot of people are going to get hurt [wait for the economy to tank!] before Twitler is impeached and removed from office: that is the only political goal of any portent.

Progressives and Democrats will have to sort things out later about what is to be their new political agenda for Americans.  But first, we must drive Twitler and his fascist supporters from public life and back into the hole that they came from."

"Sexist trash.  Really?...woman are not tough?

It's for you on the phone.  The 1950s are calling and they want their attitudes back."
"I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.

Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):

Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of ""Here is my black guy""; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.

Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only ""locker room banter"".

Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same."
"Uhh...one doesn't become a ""protected class"" as a favor.

Constitutionally:
1. The Government (not the person)
2. Must prove
3. An immutable characteristic 
4. For a class of people
5. With historical discrimination
6. That lacks sufficient political power to protect itself at the ballot box (political or market)

That's an incredibly narrow set of conditions. For those others outside this, who know not the level and depth of discrimination at issue, to ""self-victim-ify"" is disgusting as well as pathetic."

"That Clinton shill Comey, was appointed by GWB. He is not a shill and the fact you call him one after a racist screed about how the country will be better once it we get rid of all these illegals, just proves your ignorance.

If Trump is so looking forward to this investigation, why doesn't he just go testify under oath, instead of juts tweet snipping like a punk."

"Moral equivalence between the US, a liberal democratic Republic, and NK, a fascist tyranny run by a criminally-insane madman won't wash.

1) Dissenters in NK are punished by execution or torture and extended stays in concentration camps.
Non-violent dissent is a right in the US.

2) The US avoids violence when it can.  NK systematically uses violence against its own citizens and is currently threatening many countries around the world with annihilation because they have criticized NK.

3) The US basically observes international law.  NK regularly breaks international law, especially UN sanctions.

4) NK is based upon autarky. The US trades globally.

5) Military service is compulsory in NK and voluntary in the US.

6) NK leadership is based upon a divine cult of personality. US politicians are political pinatas.

7) NK believes that Koreans are the master race. The US severely punishes racists.

NK is an awful dictatorship run by a fascist, lunatic thug.

The US is flawed, but good."

"What bunch of losers and idiots!  I clearly heard President Trump consistently state he does not support these racist groups or their points of view since the campaign last year.  Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant."
"Interesting. For eight years conservative media considered President Obama a Manchuria Candidate. Liberal media scoffed it off including Bernstein. 

Now liberal media launch attack President Trump on his mental fitness. 

So  - According to media Obama sold out America in a treasonous activity and Trump is a doddering old fool. 

Hahaha - and media expects to be believed?  No way 

Perhaps it's media that is the doddering old fool with a Manchuria candidate mandate."
"And you need to stop taking the pills - Trump is a venal, mendacious huckster and con man who believes himself above any laws. He will likely be brought down by his fellow GOPers before he drags them so far into the mud they cannot find the way out."

There are SO many places where serious, and absolutely fundamental work on the church itself is needed.  ANY of those areas (women, homosexuality, etc.) could in and of themselves be considered a major problem.  But for me, I continue to see the scandal as that point of entrance/departure.  

In the US, many places have ""sexual predator"" laws, that  place limits on where a sexual predator can live, and that require (depending on where you live) varying degrees of notice.  I understand the need to offer compassion and support to these kinds of people, and see good in doing just that.  But at the same time, they are not likely the first people I consider inviting to dinner, a backyard BBQ, or my everyday life.  I can imagine a predator who might also be a wonderful artist, or have great skills in some area.  That doesn't erase the problem.  Same with the church..."
IDIOT
You can't get rid of the EC without a constitution amendment. It's part of the actual constitution. Good luck with that because the state's have to sign off on it and the small-population states would be pretty stupid if they let go of what little power they have left to affect the national government.

So,  here is a challenge, please provide ONE example of the President saying something racist.  And no, his comments saying ""there are rapists"", coming from Mexico does not count. 1) because it is true 2) legal status has nothing to do with race.

A Republican party devoted to establishing fascist theocracy led by a Kakistocracy leading to a Kleptocracy of corporate dictators reigning supreme over all other humans.  All created within the minds of think tankers paid by the Billionaire Barons to dredge up the past insanities successfully destroying entire nations for the profits of war.  The Republican party has declared itself as completely traitorous to our nation and most of the civilized world.  The nominees for president, to a man, certified their traitorous intent.

We are not going to bomb them, Donnie.

I believe Trump thought that threatening N. Korea elevated his stature and felt so good that now he'll threaten any country (except Russia, of course) that is acting up."
"Good question, and it probably depends who you ask. The advocates will sing the praises of a well run ""rest stop"", about how clean they are and how respectful the residents are. There are some land owners who are willing to allow ""temporary"" rest stops, and others who, for what ever reason, are adamantly opposed.
There are advocates of the homeless who don't give a rip how the neighbors feel and try to establish rest stops where ever there's a vacant lot. If you object, it's because you're evil, greedy, selfish, cowardly, cruel, and a pathetic excuse for a human being, and you don't  understand that homelessness is your responsibility to cure."

"Well said. Typical fake news from the left-wing MSM. Just like when they kept on reporting that President Trump had called all Mexicans rapists and drug dealers. He did no such thing, the MSM cherry picked which words to use in the quote attributed to him. The actual quote:

""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,"" Trump said. ""They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.

"Enough of your silly comments.  You are not ""local.""  I have been pointing this out for a long time here on the good old G and M - one of the reasons rich people come here is they know they can pay no income tax, while shamelessly using health care and other provincial and civic services.  Trudeau gutlessly refuses to have the CRA simply ENFORCE THE LAW.  We had a little furore a while ago about non-collection of capital gains tax and/or the property transfer tax.  Ideally those would be collected, too.   BUT the real money is in the fact that they don't report worldwide income, or even all their ""Canadian"" income.  So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.  Take immigrants based on skills only, not money.  Investigate deeply when a ""housewife"" with no taxable income buys a $3.5 M house.

Obviously you've tried to tell management that your manager isn't very good. And what happens? Well, a little bit of pussy-footing. And your manager briefly changes her behavior and then goes back to her old ways. 

Management usually is loathed to look over a manager's shoulder. So things have to get pretty bad before they decide, ""It's the coach, not the players"". 

And this might be a bit of the ""Un-fireable Employee"" syndrome where, despite all evidence to the contrary, they will be the last one given the boot. (I have no idea how anyone gets to this exulted state, but it happens.) 

Your boss seems incapable of changing her ways and senior management seems to just want to smooth things over.

"This ""Islamophobia"" label is as tired as it is wrong.

Religious prejudice being what it is, Islamic peoples have a strong leaning towards anti-Semitism, and when they blow things up or persecute minorities from the ancient churches, anti-Christianism. Then, of course, there's the terrible history that followed Mountbatten's Partition and the millions of lives that were lost in the conflicts between India and Pakistan. So Islamic peoples also have a history of Hinduphobia that most people in the West are ignorant of. 

So let's say that if you're an Islamophile, you could well be a Judeo-Christian-o-phobe and a Hinduphobe.

If you want to throw the Islamophobia label around, you can't suck and blow at the same time.

The Liberal motion M103 privileges Islamic peoples over Hindus, Christians, and Jews who have been subject to persecution by Islamic groups.

You interpreted this to be sexual abuse and demanded that I report anything I know to the police and eventually, you emailed that police about my comment.  Your bullying was exceptional.  But this is not about you or me.  It is about acceptable procedure for state schools in dealing with citizens.  Time will tell what will happen.  There are many abuses within and victims of our system.  You see them on street corners with signs, living along the river, etc.  You think Trump is a sociopath.  But you are apparently happy as a clam when the system destroys lives."
Just how bad is this going to get when a university can take action against a student for sexual assault when no assault took place and the victim confirms that no assault took place. The university should be bracing for a major financial setback for making an obviously stupid decision.
"Horgan is going to run huge deficits with borrowed money and punish BC's resource sector with red tape and taxes under the guise of ""sustainability"". The NDP has no credibility, they represent fiscal incompetence and short-sighted idealism. The Liberals are the best choice for negotiating softwood lumber issues and David Emerson is respected across party lines. Horgan is going to pay self-serving unions with a record of supporting US protectionism. Horgan is the equivalent to the Notley,Wynne,Robertson clown shows - he promises unicorn and rainbows with a willful ignorance of reality. The BC Liberals are not perfect but the NDP would be the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Imagine Greggor Robertson's smug eco-zealot ignorance applied to the entire province and look out."
"Why would any denouncing of the harassment of Notley help to reduce the anti-Alberta bigotry of you, or others?

Are you offering some sort of bargain: you'll cease to be a bigot if I denounce these ""yahoos"" you refer to?

Why on earth would I make such a bargain? Shame, shame on you. Treating decency like a bargaining commodity. Shame."
"You do realize you're on the losing side, right? We American service members love to kill Nazis... geez, my Grandpa personally killed hundreds of them in WW2."
"The ultimate irony with the Hebdo cover is that literally thousands of Texans fought and died in WWII, many on French soil including during D-Day to help liberate France from the real Nazis, Hitler's Nazis, not some imaginary fake Texas Nazis who don't even really exist. Many of the dead flood victims were poor, African-American and Hispanic Texans who didn't have the means to escape, including that woman whose poor kid was clinging to her floating body before being rescued. That kid is black. Oh, but she ""deserved"" to see her mother die, it was ""karma"" because the state she happened to live in leans Republican and Trump got all their electoral votes. That's the sick, twisted logic of ignorant liberal-progressives."
"First of all, your blanket statement that there is no private health insurance in Canada is untrue. Check out Blue Cross, Great West Life, Sunlife , etc. .

"That's exactly what the organization Right Wing Watch determined when the group was calling itself the Alaska Family Council.  The Southern Poverty Law Center deemed the mothership, the Family Research Council a hate group.  So the current iteration of idiocy changed the name to Alaska Family Action.  Some very interesting reporting on the mothership here:  http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/dozens-of-gop-leaders-declare-solidarity-with-those-who-want-to-see-homosexuality-outlawed/   Minnery is on that page.  If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see a former Indiana Congressman's name on there as well.  Connect the dots you amateur sleuths.  The thoroughly lacking except for ability to collect funds ""advocacy"" group ""Alliance Defending Freedom"" group will likely be pulled into this.

The arrogance in this statement, for example: ""I find it interesting that you don't acknowledge the faults in your thought process, especially once you've been called out on them"" followed immediately by the hypocritical statement: "" I don't attack anyone""  then, ""Think about it or at least try to think about it."" You clearly attack others.  You're also a grade A+ asshole."
Lol what a dumb headline. Not even worth reading article. Trudeau clinched the deal despite christy Clark.  I read elsewhere that Trudeau knew about this issue and was going to give in to her demand lol.

As an American Jew it's disgusting to see someone with and Israeli flag support a fascist like Adolph Trump. Israeli media and government have been Trump apologizers for a long time. It is mind boggling to see the Jewish state align itself with such a vile white supremacist fascist pig like our imbecile-in-chief. Any Jew who stands by Donald Trump is a traitor to the Jewish people.

"My wife retired as a full-time nursing professor a couple of years ago and her position is now being staffed by several part-timers.  The nursing program has been running since the colleges took them over in the 60's and has no signs of slowing down.  How is this reacting to market forces?  They need experienced full-time staff for the majority of the program delivery and continuity to ensure quality.

The reality is that instead these colleges have loaded up management administrators at the expense of front-line teaching staff.  The number of these managers has DOUBLED over the past 16 years while the number of faculty members has decreased relative to the number of students in the same period.  I estimate that the college system could save $200 million annually just by going back to the 2001 ratio of management to students.

What other organizations have doubled their management staff ratio?  It's ridiculous."

I apologize for pursuing an education, for informing myself about what is happening in the real world. I know my facts and feel sorry for you, I really do. You are too stubborn to realize the damage your ways of thought inflict upon humanity. 

The evidence is all there, I EVEN SAID THERE IS A NATURAL EBB AND FLOW TO THE CLIMATE AND THAT IT HAS INCREASED IN THE PAST AS WELL.

Saudi Arabia want's Alaska's oil market share so they manipulated the market with a flood of oil! With $800 billion in their bank they have time on their side! 

This is an old Arab trick and it will work on Alaska if the leaders let it.

Parnell, I disagree with you respectfully when you said..""When the market says the oil comes out of the ground the oil will come out.""  

I feel once you show oil & gas investors bad policy or bad faith they leave and don't always come back! Ask those who left already and those getting ready to leave Alaska!

The incentives & Credits are finding lots of oil, look at Armstrong with the billion barrels plus at Pikkia, Caelus at Smith Bay, Blue Crest at Cosmo, Furie at Kitchen Lights Gas Discovery with the first offshore Platform since they put the Osprey Platform on my old oil field. 

The oil market is being manipulated with an oil glut, I hope Alaska will not be Saudi's fool"

I mean after this silly show, what intelligent person who cares for those who more truly needed that money than Chin ... school children, Medicaid dependents, elderly, the homeless, would ever vote such an arrogant,  self-centered, self-promoting person into Public Office?

It is not 1% of players showing disrespect.  It is closer to 30% and some entire teams would not come out for the Anthem or knelt together.  Did you see the news on the London games?  NFL players knelt IN ENGLAND for the US Anthem and Flag, yet stood up for the British Anthem and Colors.  How stupid is that?  
It is my right to spend not $1 nor 1 minute on the NFL or their advertisers ever again.  That is the beauty of America and free speech.

"The Liberals were elected with a mandate to run small deficits in order to fund infrastructure upgrades, with the budget to be returned to a balanced state before the next election.

In actual fact, the Liberals have run enormous deficits with no end in sight, and none of it has anything to do with infrastructure spending. 

This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, since it is absolutely consistent with the way every other Liberal government currently, and historically, has squandered tax dollars.

What is not impressive it is the continued stupidity of the Canadian electorate, who keep putting Liberals into positions of power in spite of overwhelming evidence of this party's consistent pattern of incompetence, arrogance, and criminal activity over the past 50 years."

"10% of society has had gay sex.  Full time gays may be 3% or it may be more.  Asexuals are 1% or 2%.  Heteros largely left the priesthood when Paul liberalized exit and the fear of discipline ended with Vatican II.  The population sizes are close enough to make it reasonable that half the remaining priests are gay (and some of my priest friends will tell you how gay) while the other half is likely asexual (with many of the gay priests towing the asexual line).  I won't call asexuals an aberration, but I will insist that they quit monopolizing the Magisterium about sex.  The first step is that they find some degree of self-realization followed by public disclosure and a reworking of the doctrine they assumed to be universal, when it is only a sexual peculiarity."

"So, Bernstein is also calling for the assassination of the President, hmmm?

Good riddance. This clown was a tool.
"The Nazi's and white supremacy murdered millions of people last century and caused a world war.  No, they do not deserve ANY tolerance for their vile and dangerous attitudes and actions and the rhetoric against them should be strident. It is false equivalence to equate Lincoln's attitude toward the south and the current reaction to the repugnant views and goals of the alt right.  In fact, I found your post insulting to the true greatness of Lincoln.  The civil war was also about the economic dependency of the south on slavery and Lincoln recognized that for what it was.  The south didn't represent the pure, unmitigated hate and violence that the alt right does. The confederate statues erected long after the civil war weren't symbols of heroism or even a ""celebration"" of history (to the losers), they were erected as signs of intimidation and on-going and growing racism. Here we are, long after WWII, should we put up statues of Hitler or Stalin..."

So what's it gonna take folks? What is going to be his next misogynist move? Does he have to personally insult each and every one of his mother's supporters?"

"Gerry Guay-
You are so far out to lunch on this issue it's not even funny.  First of all, since when does someone who is committed to doing something about climate change have to hang up any and all possible links to carbon emissions?  Maybe the mayor drives an electric car and does what he can when he can to reduce his own footprint.  If everyone did that it'd make a notable reduction in our country's CO2 output.  
You know how science has also shown how excessive fat and sugar are harmful for us?  Why don't you cut out ALL consumption of both, huh Gerry?  I guess you aren't that committed to health... See how dumb your original comment seems now?
The BEST business decision would have been to STAY in the Paris agreement.  That's why so many of our largest companies' CEOs came out against Trump's move to leave the agreement.  Maybe, Gerry, just maybe Trump is foolishly ignorant about most things and did this just to save face with his base.  60% of Americans disagree with him on this."
"Trump will quickly learn that he cannot simply ""scrap"" NAFTA.    Not when every major auto manufacturer has over two decades of organizing their supply chains based upon this deal.    But it sure sounded tough during the campaign.    

It's good for Canada to get ahead of the curve on this before Trump does something stupid."
"A ""real American"" would reject a person like Donald Trump, who is completely unfit and unqualified to run a country. He needs a mental evaluation, and then once it's confirmed he's unfit to make decisions affecting our country and its citizens, he needs to be ousted. he's a racist, sexist, mentally incompetent, pathological liar who doesn't deserve any respect from anyone. Sad."

"The Iraq War was an enormous mistake, but that is one sick comment. You are, in effect, blaming Hilary Clinton and all those who voted for or supported the war for the Orlando attack. And practically speaking you are totally wrong. ISIS wants those types of invasions from the West. ISIS and people like the terrorist in Orlando want war with the West. So his attack was in no way a retaliation for the Iraq war. 

Your comment shows more your self-hatred (your guilt by association of being American) and hatred for your country."

"It is a good thing for Alaskans that he pushed back against Don Young's stupid idea of a 2 million acre state forest that would be taken from Tongass National Forest lands.  How can the state manage forests and get out timber sales?  we have no funding to staff a state forest and build roads and manage it.  It is better off in federal hands so they can put money into Alaska and put together the sales, build the roads, hire the foresters, and do the work.  
Also, if it is in State lands, subsistence and rural access regulations don't apply so those of us who live here have reduced seasons, reduced bag limits, and less access."
Are you kidding me ?  Like Murkowski doesn't care about  Alaska schools ?  She works hard for Alaskan's on all issues.

Someone like Trump could only emerge from of a completely broken-down political system. Our economy is not working for a lot of people in 2016 and Trump is better than the rest at explaining how/why.

What are the qualifications of the people and organization that put out this report? Oh, right, it doesn't matter as the media loves sensationalism and negative commentary, and if it has to do with obesity lots of obese people will click the bait. 

I love the racial inequities in obesity - apparently white folks are responsible for the fact that minorities tend to be more obese - it can't be genetics, because there is no genetic component to behavior, intelligence or health, and if you're obese it's someone else's fault and it's the government's job to make fat people stop eating so much.

"The article says ""At least 44 people were killed in Egypt in bomb attacks at the cathedral of the Coptic Pope and another church on Palm Sunday, prompting anger and fear among Christians and leading to troop deployments and the declaration of a three-month state of emergency"".

Muslims in Egypt have attacked Christians and their churches before.

And Muslims have attacked Christians and burned their churches in Pakistan.

I don't think the Christians in Egypt and Pakistan are attacking Muslims in Iraq or Syria and I don't think they are attacking Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims so why would Muslims attack Christians in Egypt and Pakistan? That doesn't seem very tolerant. 

If Muslims aren't following the verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers, why are Muslims attacking Coptic Christians in Egypt and why are Muslims attacking Christians and burning their churches in Pakistan?

Please explain the reason."

"Here's how it works in Oregon and I know this from personal experience.  You need three independent medical opinions that you have less than six months to live.  The patients, who are usually in extreme pain, get the prescription and administer it themselves........IF THEY WANT TO TAKE IT.  Here's the kicker and this stat is available online.  85% of those who receive the drugs, never use them!  The fact that it is available to them is so soothing and comforting, they just pass away from their disease naturally.  Shame on our legislators.  Death With Dignity or the option to untilize it is a good thing.  There are so many safeguards.  No doc in the world is gonna sign off on a patient who says they want to die so their family doesn't have to pay so much $$$.  When these legislators get old I hope they don't get a mega pain terminal disease.  They will wish they had this option as they are in agonizing pain.  Five courageous states have this law on the books.  We are a disgrace."

"We can be certain that the subjects of the bus and McCandless will come up again.  And again, Hallelujah. About 5-6 years ago the Anchorage weekly free paper, PRESS, had a two full page article on why this incident hits such a nerve with Alaskans.  The author advanced the theory that disproportional numbers of Alaskans have  ""dumb stuff that I could have got killed while doing but I got away with it"" lists.  He suggested that many Alaskans look at Chris McCandless and see their younger and dumber selves, and don't much like what they see.

We visit battlefields like Gettysburg, Verdun and Waterloo.  Also the site of the St Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, Auschwitz, Dachau,  the atomic bomb Trinity test site in New Mexico, and the Old 97 wreck site near Danville, VA.  Since the site coordinates are known, the site will be visited, even if the bus is sent down Orwell's memory hole.

The Chi Coms  would not allow us to fly the plane out after the crew was released and the plane had to be dismantled and flown out
on a large air cargo transport plane. Even more humiliating in the years since,  US intelligence has determined that the Chi Coms had indeed been able to gleam important methods and
technology from the recon plane as the crew had not been able to properly destroy the spying equipment that was on the plane as they had not been properly trained for such an
eventuality and did not have the means to do so.  The Chi Coms love to make the US look like fools.  Do not want to see this happen again."

Because they are entitled, egocentric and desperate, they do not experience it as wrong. They are determined to gratify their wishes and furious if thwarted. Their desire can be so consuming that there is little comprehension of, respect for or ability to empathize with the other.

"Trolls go away! This piece is about the asinine immigration ban, not guns. Begone, trolls, and get back under your bridges.

As for the topic in question -- a new immigration ban done in a different way, one can only say that although Trump is persistent, he is at least an idiot of the first class. Nearly certifiable. The USA should worry about what they have done to themselves.

""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.""

I recall generally liking the moral premise behind Obamacare and sincerely hoped it mirrored Medicare in how it controls prices on the provider level to keep insurance rates steady. I find out later that it doesn't and that it lacks allowables and other price controls, probably on purpose, which allows rates and costs to rise out of control. If they would just add a provider price control the way Medicare has, Obamacare can still work and there will be no need to take away the insurance that is getting me the treatment I need.

The bedrock of our great nation and it's still great no matter what trump and his supporters say for their own benefit, is the legitimacy of the presidential vote. I don't care what your politics are you don't start down the path of rejecting that. 

He has no idea what he's doing, he has no idea of the potential consequences of such talk and he doesn't care because it's all about his paper thin ego. This is proof enough he has no business being president.

Hillary is everything you expect from a career politician, a real shady a**hole, but that can't legitimize voting for someone who is both so ignorant and so callous as to threaten the continuation of our democracy because he's got a tiny penis"

Sure, they look really, really foolish right now.  But, they're our guys.  Like our brothers (either Cain or Abel, take your pick).  Not to be paranoic or anything, but part of me feels like Trump, in his narcissism, was sitting back and saying, ""I gotta get some jollies, I think I'll make my supporters look like fools"", and it's like he waited until Poch and les and RTH gave full throated support and argued ""no chaos"", and then did this to make them look foolish (again).

It's not tawdry enough, it doesn't have enough gilt, it doesn't have his picture or his name plastered all over it the way his own places have. It's no ""dump,"" Trump. It just happens to be occupied by an ignorant, shallow, creature of no class, no real knowledge and no character. All Trump has is ego...and, that means trouble for all of us. It was sad enough with Obama in it. The sadness continues. And, Trump wasn't even in there. Perhaps, God was showing how glad even He was that Trump was elsewhere at that moment."

"The fact that Trump got elected contradicts your opinion. He appointed a white racist to head the DOJ. He was endorsed by Nazis and Klansmen. BTW, why don't white folks take responsibility for their choices? No one is forcing them to live in red states that are net welfare recipients from blue states. No one is forcing them to do drugs, over eat, and other self destructive behaviors. Globalization is not kind to the poorly educated white folks that elected Trump. He can't change that, even with Putin's help. The coal industry jobs are never coming back. Republicans have been doing everything they can to keep the poor in poverty, breathing and drinking pollution. They are still using the Southern Strategy to recruit white racists to the GOP. The GOP is just a white identity party these days. Poorly educated white folks are the only demographic dying younger. They are killing themselves. No one is trying to prevent them from voting. They vote against their self interest."

"Its against our human rights and highly illegal to ever of had any drug illegal, pot, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy. The government is way out of its jurisdiction on what they are in existence for. Driving while impaired on one of these substances should be illegal and prosecuted by law or other heavy machinery just as the same rules apply to prescription medication already. Free up our police to prosecute real crimes such as murder, rape, pedophiles and empty our prisons of drug users to make sure we have room for them. And also free up the courts backlogged by these ridiculous archaic drug laws so we don't have to let murderers go because they take to long to get to court because they are filled with stupid drug cases."
This is the price we pay for having someone who doesn't believe in science as president.  Trump is an intellectual cretin.
Wrong.  You should read the story.  No one died here from alcohol poisoning.  A fool decided to imbibe and get behind the wheel.  The alcohol didn't force itself on him.  He made a choice to drink and drive.

"Pathetic.

Norway has been building pipelines under the North Sea for 40 years, built onshore and offshore oil & gas terminals. No major spills (to best of my knowledge). The North Sea is a far rougher and more dangerous environment for shipping than the sheltered waters off the BC coast. No major spills (to best of my knowledge). Norway is also an environmental leader and, of course, is home to pristine Norwegian fjords.

If Norway can protect its environment and at the same time build the infrastructure to develop its oil & gas resources then why can't Canada?"
The stupid part is that you just comment without actually doing any type of research. The death penalty has been proven that it does not deter crime and costs more money to house an inmate vs lufe sentences.
You are incapable of having an intelligent discussion on this issue as that would require intelligence. Time and again you run from the facts that destroy and humiliate your posts of ignorance because you are incapable of manning up. That would require being a man. Now you behave like an emotional cripple. You can't refute the facts so you go straight into grade school insults and you suck at that too.
What you really want is for the taxpayers to propagate your religious nonsense.

Trump's trouble is that he's so incompetent that his scam is falling down around his ears.

"""...The United States has this problem with income inequality, perhaps you've heard of it. It is at the center of this healthcare issue as well...""
  ""Income inequality"" is the most stupid, ridiculous concept statist elites throw around as if they can do anything about it. The simple fact is that the world consists of stupid people, lazy people, uneducated people, ignorant people, smart people, motivated people, educated people, and knowledgeable people. People are all individuals.  As long as everyone is permitted to follow their own paths and protected by the same laws, government has done all it should.  It is called equality of opportunity not equality of outcome."
"They will make the fatherland great again, they say,

They condemn revelation of inconvenient facts as merely the continued plotting of the Lügenpresse. 


And they brag to their admirers about the inspiration for all those plans, not being the least bit shy about doing so.

That's the kind of thing that generates sudden hostility that Seela Sankey seems to be surprised by. Actually, on Monday I did have a woman driving her Lexus SUV with a dog in her lap pull halfway into a street and then suddenly stop when she realized I was driving in the other half. OK, I didn't spit on her, but it wasn't because she was white. It was more an issue of my closed car window. If she could have heard the obscenity I screamed, she might have wanted to go share her victimhood at this rally, but being white she would not have been allowed to speak."
Nothing made me happier than listening to the desperation in Romneys voice as the lying hypocrite tried to kick sand on Trump.

"No. Your analogy is stupid. Because the taxpayers did not pay for your house. But privatization of resources we paid for is theft. It does not belong to the state. The state has no right to sell it. It belongs to the taxpayers. The state is employed to manage it. 
The only way privatization of government infrastructure can be just is if it is preceeded by a referendum where a two thirds majority of the owners (us) approved the sale and every cent of the sale is returned to us as tax rebates. You do not get to sell my property without my consent and even if get consent the proceeds are mine not yours."

Why does ANY COMPANY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD be required to store data online?  Each and every excuse as to when and where data should be stored by every IT dept is completely bogus!

Here is an idea.   ANY INFORMATION that is stored online by any organization immediately be completely isolated.  I can tell ANYONE how to do that in 5 minutes.

Here is an idea.  The SEC and the Government in Canada and the US immediately freeze all of EQUIFAX assets, and those of EVERY BOARD MEMBER and OFFICER.  There is more damage done that this pathetic company is worth.

"It costs a fortune to run a grow operation in your house. Electricity, depending on the size of the operation can run upwards of $2,000 per month. My guess is that the line was diverted after the bills were received. The writer could have done a better job of explaining. The rest of the story? Should have an inspector found the problem? I would hope so but not all inspectors are the same, especially in a fast moving market. The former owner obviously knew there was a problem. This case will get settled out of court and the former owner will pay.

The rest? Pot sucks. The law should not allow home grown. I know several homeowners who no longer rent properties long term. They will place a clause in the lease saying it is not allowed, and it still happens. As far as property owners should be concerned, Pot is the new Meth."

""Let's all see whom and how we can hurt the most today!""  The twisted alphabet soup of agencies and programs that are being cut/eliminated/reduced have real impact on actual people.  Is there a list somewhere of those next on the Gov's chopping block?  What is the Fed going to DO with this land they are so cavalierly repossessing -- from those who have a long history of being oppressed and lied to by the same Fed?  Are there undeveloped resources out in that desert that are crying out to be exploited?  What is the freaking purpose of all this rape and pillage being methodically undertaken by the Trump administration?  I think I need some right-wing mansplaining, and darn quickly, because this (et al) just seems shockingly stupid."
"Every time you think you've seen peak stupidity out of this crew, they get dumber.

Excuse me if I side with tens of thousands of scientists instead of Trump. Do you know any scientists? I know a few right-wingers and although some are quite intelligent their hatred of the left seems to blind them to certain aspects or reality. Perhaps with such flawed brains we deserve what we will get as a species. Too bad we have to take the rest of the planet with us.

"Two of the top educational systems in the world are in Singapore and Finland. They have for many years destroyed the US in terms of student outcomes. 

Singapore has a highly structured top-down system with  tightly scripted control of curriculum and testing for all students from the central government. Finland has a similar approach - there is no such thing as a private school - and many credit its success to 1) placing a high national value on the teaching profession and paying teachers accordingly and 2) paid high-quality universal preschool and daycare for all kids ages 3-7.

Neither country touts ""school choice"". They have committed to, and invest appropriately, in a consistent and top notch universal education for ALL of their country's students.  

But don't let facts get in the way of your effort to tear apart the US educational system. Carry-on with your ignorance..."
"Prepare for a 10% bump in Property Taxes, which are already far too high. If I have the good fortune of working another 10 years and contributing at my current  rate, assuming a reasonable rate of return (5%), I MAY (and that is a big MAY) be able to retire in my early 60's and draw out about 48k per year, which would be less than half of my CURRENT salary,  after paying in around a million,  These guys are making MORE than their salary at RETIREMENT.

"Trump's response:

Look, birds LOVE me. People always ask me what I think about birds. I have the best birds. We look at the polls and I'm winning all the birds. Okay? And that's good, that's to be expected. But listen I love birds. I'm a friend of the birds, always we've been friends.

You know what birds I hate? Chinese birds. And Muslim birds. And Mexican birds. We're going to build a birdcage for all of those birds. It's going to be a beautiful birdcage. And I'm going to make the birds pay for it. The beauty of me, and this is important. It's great. I can talk like a bird. You know, squawk. I'm very good at squawking. The best.

And someone very smart, almost as smart as me, said it is better to live one day as a hawk than 100 years as a pigeon.

"This is a pretty silly article.  The risk is pretty minimal and the navy has a team that is going to find and fix the problem.  To make this seem like it is Trump's fault is just plain silly.  If a president has to have a finger pointed at it would be Obama, as he allowed for the lack of project management on the overpriced, behind schedule F35, he allowed for the massive budget cuts on the F18's spare parts and maintenance, yet pushed them to their limits for his misadventures around the world.

No, it is self-serving of these special interests groups. What value do they add to Canada? These individuals do not represent the value of average Canadian's, or their first priority.  Gays should stop deluding themselves into thinking that the average Canadian really cares about gay rights. They don't. Do they care about heterosexual rights? No, didn't think so.
Second, John Ibbistson should not be writing a piece promoting gay refugees over others without disclosing he himself is gay. Full disclosure John. Enough is enough. There are far more needy people out in the world that need Canada's help then homosexuals from a far off country.

There's already pressure to buy online given cheap shipping and wider selection along with the lower costs.  Yes, people will still eat out and buy knik-nacks downtown, but it's going to make it harder for Lowe's or AIH to stock a $1200 generator, or for stores to sell expensive clothes.  They'll be counting more and more on impulse buyers and less on people shopping local.

Since when has the USA been a war torn land.  These people were living and being cared for there some of them for many years.    They see Canada with better handouts and here they come borders be damned.
Most of us have no problem with legal immigrants who apply and meet the criteria and have something to offer.  These people are freeloaders looking for the best deal they can get.  They should all be shipped back to the US and let them apply like all other immigrants.  They are not refugees coming from the safe haven of the USA."
"Most Canadians do not live in such luxury. Harper never complained ,nor did Chretien. The PM should rent his own house and the RCMP can provide security.  Trudeau is a pampered jerk and spends our money like the Dauphin he is. Sell 24 Sussex to the Chinese- they will buy anything ."

"Thank God we have a news media that will expose Trump's alternative facts, misinformation and, in this case, distortions of what the mayor of London actually said. In the wake of a deadly terrorist attack, our president decided the best thing to do in support of our ally was revive his personal feud with the mayor of London:

Khan was obviously telling Londoners not to be alarmed about the increased police presence they would see today. Fox News carried it, so I'm sure Trump heard the whole statement. He's simply a pathological liar."

"Weird way to put it: ""Trump...sending Germany’s Angela Merkel off to cry in her beer."" 
Um, Merkel raised a glass with fellow statesman and fellow credentialed experts and fellow enlightened citizens, laughed, rolled her eyes, shook her head, and went soberly about the business of being a laudable, capable leader in charge of an economic powerhouse and, partially, of wherever Europe goes next.

Fly them all over you-know-where with impunity, kill with impunity, violate sovereign borders with impunity. Accountable to no one. It's the world biggest terror shop. 
Most Americans are blind to CIA horror. So are, sadly, many Canadians. Decades of propaganda degrades the mind.
Today the CIA number one order is to restart the Cold War with Russia, and start a new war with China. Thus elevates threat to a degree to sustain the $1 trillion annual budget for the war machine. Help crush the American economy. 
I have been saying the American war machine' aggression is stupid. I got a lot of blowback. And now, Trump just said the same thing publicly after being briefed by the CIA. Hurray!"

Lets give them 33% of whats there to keep as an emergency fund, that is 20 billion dollars.  That would give every eligible Alaskan $62,700.  Those who are smart with their finances would pay off debts, buy new homes or spend it wisely giving a massive boost to the local economy. Those who are leaches will leave as there is no more fund.  Those who are dumb with their money, well, too bad.  Its your choice.  As for my family i would have a paid off house which would give me $9240 a year in extra income plus a massive emergency fund.  Heck, i may even splurge on a new car."

"Stigmatizing children is not the purpose of laws criminalizing child prostitution. Instead, it is to remove economic incentive both from the children and the pimps who use them, and to legally remove the children from practicing the trade. Without the tools the criminalization in law provides, the police cannot arrest the children and remove them from their pimps or the next John who would sexually abuse them. The thinking in this decriminalization is shallow, foolish and immoral and could only happen in a state run by liberal non-thinkers."
"Only a deranged liberal would accuse those defending the Truth as whiners. We Faithful Catholics are sick you, Francis, the faggots in clergy and every other liberal disease infecting the Church.

"Earlier this year Islamophobia saved Notre Dame in Paris from being blown up by a car bomb driven by 3 Muslim women in burqas.  People thought it very odd that three women in black drapery covering their faces were driving erratically around the cathedral looking for a parking spot. The car was filled with  propane gas canisters and would have collapsed a good portion of the 1000 year old monument.  There have been 3 such attempts by Muslims to destroy the cathedral in 2 years.  To more and more people in Europe and North America now, Islamophobia is just common sense."
"Hey BARRY HERTZ, read your review/editorial on the movie Filth City. You are an idiot. 
First off, you use the word ""pedestrian"" which automatically indicates your douche bagery. 
You write for the sake of your ears hearing your own words as you recite them. You are a low life, smug, condescending, no talent, wannabe, Z list reviewer and coward. 
I have no affiliation with this film what-so-ever, but can't wait to watch it on Netflix. I am sure it will get millions of views.

"So under the law of unintended consequences does my 3-year old get arrested when I have to bring her into the men's room? Oh, I forgot, the American Taliban will beat me up there first like happened in a Wal-Mart restroom. Isn't there a Freudian stage where kids (mentally and physically) get fixated on bathroom functions? Geez."
"I'm confused by what you wrote.  Perhaps you would clarify.  
You state: ""we white practitioners are totally baffled by how we change the meta dynamics of family structure in Native communities.""  Then, you go on to talk about the high level of child sexual abuse in those communities and the increasing rate of teenage suicide.
Are you suggesting that white practitioners are changing the dynamics of family structure in such a way that abuse is increased?  Or are the two coincidental?  Or is it that you are baffled that you are unable to change the dynamics?  
I'm sorry that my question may be stupid, but I'm really unclear about what you wrote."
The problem with Islam is that it's false religion. Allah is Lucifer.

And the planet has prospered historically with higher CO2 levels.  Foolish politicians and by extension citizens being run by eco-loonie leftist activists."
"I am very pleased to see that Judge Watson and AG Chin have, once again, done the right things. While defending the rights of immigrants, they are protecting all of our rights.

So , why is a conservative you disagree with a troll , yet liberals you agree with , not ?  Kathleen Kearon cares enough about issues to take her time to comment . That should be admired .

If your boss paid you $2/hr and his competitor offered you $20/hr, would you change employers? You're darn right you would. As for the state rehiring folks to ""do their same job,"" that's the reason we're in this boat in the first place-overly bloated state government. And if you're suggesting  the state run its oil company, there is a word for that-communism- not thanks, that's a proven loser. Besides, these morons in Juneau have already proven they can't handle money."
"This has nothing to do with sexism, but observation! I saw it yesterday and I was pissed. When I see it, it is mostly a young white woman - however, this past weekend, I did see a young Asian woman do the same.

A typical and stupid overreaction.
"tRump has relished calling women “dogs,” “slobs” and “pigs”. He’s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women. When Tucker Carlson once mocked him on air, tRump called the pundit and left a voicemail: “It’s true you have better hair than I do. But I get more p***y than you do.” He’s ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent (Carly Fiorina) and an opponent’s wife (Heidi Cruz). His campaign openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice-president.  Trump has a long history of debasing women he’s worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. He’s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation: “Women, you have to treat ‘em like s**t.”  tRump tried to rape Jill Harth. His ex-wife Ivana, under oath, accused tRump of  a vicious rape  in 1989.  A woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein."
"I work for a company in Anchorage that employs 30 people, a big incentive of why I and 6 of my colleagues moved to AK 3 years ago was because there is no state income tax. If there is going to be a state income tax people will leave the state and even worse less people will move up here, it's that simple. Maybe the bigger problem is that AK has more government employees (by far) than any other state, google it. They all get pensions too, so we have to make sure and pay that tax so we can keep paying something nobody else gets anymore. AK is the highest spending state per capita in the US, spending an average of $18k per resident annually, that's insane! What does the state spend that on!? But hey, keep new businesses like Uber out, get rid of incentives to have movie companies not come and film in AK, go back on the oil tax credits AK residents voted in just 2 years ago, and of course keep hiring government employees, that will fix it...so dumb. Do a sales tax or get rid of PFD."

"You sling a lot of both, and substance doesn't play a dominant role. And, I made none of the personal attacks (like ""Nastytoga"") that you are well known for on this forum, where you reign as Cranky Poster Supreme.

"Wow, how can you be so wrong.  A) this is NOT a very conservative state.  There are twice as many of us independents than the combined sum of GOP and Democrats. B) Because of the GOP's closed caucuses you consistently put to the voters the most alt-right radical version of the GOP here in Alaska.  Open up your caucus and you will see more moderate GOP folks in Juneau. C) this State ranks only behind Mississippi as a welfare state.  We get back from the lower 48 states about 4 federal dollars for each 1 dollar we pay into the treasury.  We get welfare from donor states that you hate like CA or NY who pay much more into the treasury than they get out. So much for your BS. D) lastly, the GOP coined the words tax and spend to hide their spending on wars.  The GOP administrations have done more damage to the national debt than all the Democratic administrations combined.  Ya gotta stop sole sourcing info with Fox and the Rushbo.  Being a hypocrite parrot ain't working for you."

If Asians were doing the same, they would get it.  You're complaining that police are tackling the problem of blacks and hispanics committing crime in organized street gangs?  You condone this behavior?  Unarmed black men are killed by police officers in .001 of all encounters, so your theory of them hunting down unarmed black men is null and void.  Paid leave is paid for an investigation, if that officer is found culpable, he is fired.  Why punish an officer in a righteous encounter and response?  Show me a video that hasn't resulted in exoneration or firing?  There - I answered."

"""There are solid reasons for it.""
Such as?  You'll have to excuse me if I find Trump's actions of muzzling the bureaucracy (arguably the fourth branch of government) potentially worrying.  This is founded upon his history of functioning under grave misconceptions if not outright out of touch with reality.  For example, his attacks (""it's a witch hunt) on the intelligence community when they disclosed the conclusion that Russia was behind DNC and RNC hacks.  Also, as Trump supporters are often quick (and hypocritical) to note, Trump has only been in office for a few days.  It is questionable to assume he's attained a sufficient grasp of the bureaucracy to determine where there are issues with miscommunications in the hundreds of departments/agencies and the thousands of releases regularly produced.  I try to apply Hanlon's razor to reaching a conclusion that is based more on neglect than malice but I cannot find any plausible reasoning that points to negligence to hang this on either."
"The homeless seen on the sidewalks and parks are only one part of the homeless mess.

"Well said.  

As a Vancouver kid in the early 1930s, my father's biggest hero wasn't someone who did heroic deeds on the Somme or at Passchendaele or even Billy Barker, the Canadian aviation ace. It was a teenager on a British Cruiser at the Battle of Jutland. ""The forward 5.5 inch gun position was hit four times, killing or badly wounding all the gun crew apart from the sight setter, Boy (1st Class) John Travers (Jack) Cornwell. The badly wounded boy sailor remained at his post awaiting orders until medical assistance reached him."" (Imperial War Museum). Another reason Jack became a hero? 

""Although Cornwell survived long enough to reach hospital in Grimsby, he died of his wounds on 2 June.""  That clinched it. Clouston died, too, but not ON the beach, nor during the main evacuation. Sadly, in his case--and likely others--history had already moved on.

More to the point: Most Canadians don't care much for their history--so remain ignorant of its many fascinating personalities."

"For a party that's constantly mouthing off about their high ideals,and their so-called values, their actions instead show what they really think.  Freedom?  Only if you're big enough corporation making high enough regular donations to their reelection campaigns.  Democracy?  Only at the point of a gun if you're a third world country with oil reserves.  Liberty?  They've reserved that for themselves, allowing them the liberty to play everyone else for fools.

Watch how they act, don't be fooled by what they are saying. Most often their actions and votes are the polar opposite of what they say."
"What the parish bullies and gossips who ""use religion as a weapon against others"" don't realize is that they're putting their immortal souls in serious peril with their their cruelty, arrogance, and judgmental disposition towards people they regard as ""inferior"" and want kicked out of the church.  
I remember reading in C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"" a passage stating that a cold, self-righteous prig with a superior attitude is far closer to hell than a prostitute; this same thing holds true today.  An arrogant, gossipy parish bully who plays God is far closer to Hell than any LGBT individual."

You've obviously never been outside or borders.

'Racism' is the *norm* outside the Anglosphere.

Go to *anywhere* in Asia, or the Middle East and ask what they think of 'Black people'. They will tell you calmly, openly that Blacks are a 'lower form' of existence in one way or another.

Most places are extremely ethnocentric.

An African cannot get a remotely normal job in most Asian or Middle Eastern countries.

Most nations outside the Anglosphere have pretty strict form of social hierarchy - at least in UK, Canada, US, Australia - we recognize it and have policy, action, we make amends.

Admittedly, they try in South America but it's still open-air racism.

The assertion that it was about slavery confuses this with the nefarious 3/5s compromise, (to delegitimize it.?) Ironic, since the writer then blasts the Hastert rule, for running over the same minority rights.

I am sure the other parents in the Scout Den were thrilled at the chance to rid themselves of this mother. 

I don't care for Vicki Marble or her viewpoints on most issues, but she is dead on when she says this was a setup which Democrats are seeking to exploit. And while her 2013 comments were poorly thought out, the fact is that African Americans do eat a lot of fried chicken and barbecue. And obesity is a problem in the AA community.

More and more all the time and to keep those we have, a new understanding that does not compel obedience at the point of damnation is necessary.  That is not faith, it is making God a codependent.

I thought one, perhaps 2 depending on which john (doesn't sound like the best way to put it) actually wrote that gospel.  paul was an eye witness,  and possibly a john (lol - sorry - that's why i'm a ""bad"" Christian). paul wrote many letters, and traveled to spread his beliefs....but actual peers....?"
"Good luck on your feeble protestations, Mr. Gerson.  Trump has ushered in the wrecking ball. Today, Trump and Ryan had a ""good conversation"" about their plans for the Affordable Care Act, Immigration reform, and the future of Medicare and Medicaid.  We  know what Ryan wants, and those who voted for The Donald are going to lose ""bigly"" as their safety net disappears into the wallets of the wealthy, their jobs vanish to tariff wars, and their health care evaporates, all gone with the winds that will sweep our nation clean of hard-won progressive benefits. Those benighted Trumpistos won't even know what hit them, more's the shame.

Hey maybe your plan is to say OK Ms Criminal please don't break the law and buy/ steal/make a weapon and we will put ""shoot me"" stickers on our backs.    BTW  it was only 350 yards.  That is a 10 inch circle for any person with an M-16 even with no scope.  Darn easy shot.   Look at what european police carry to deal with this kind of problem. Look at a photo of an Israli policeman.  Those are high power weapons they carry and they are standard issue for large events or certain locations...  Point is no one could have shot back if they had to.  They were defenseless.   And depend on the law?  Took 72 minutes to break the door down.  That is longer than a flight to Vegas from Los Angeles.   The NRA has the right idea.  All you have to do is listen and think and you will see that."

"Obamacare is a disaster whose full dimensions are now becoming apparent.  Should we let the disaster get worse and worse with each passing year, or should we blow it up before it can do further damage?  This editorial is another in a long line of leftwing nonsense.

It's no surprise that the swamp-creatures, including this newspaper's editors, are squealing."
"Tell me one other right/amendment that puts people directly in harm's way like a firearm does.  I'll wait.

And yes, I know it likely wouldn't have stopped this jerk.  But it might keep them out of the hands of some other ones.  True they could steal them if they wanted.  But, walking into a store and walking out with a firearm is a lot easier for many people out there.  How 'bout those accidental deaths?  Sounds like some people could use that gun safety course. 

Curious how it would negatively affect you?  Are you a felon?  I own several rifles and a shotgun, and I'd have zero issue with it.  In fact, I'd like it, since it'd force my son to get to that course regularly.  Him being a safer gun owner warms my heart."

I see America is no different than the Imperial Roman Empire, invading and occupying other countries so civilized white collar parasites can leech off stolen resources.

Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims  have claimed influence and responsibility for the attacks.

That's interesting. The Trudeau Canadian government has allowed at least 60 Muslims to return to Canada who have been helping Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists in the Middle East.

And Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists have called on followers of Islam to use any means to attack innocent people in western societies including Canada and al Shabaab Muslim terrorists in Somalia have called on followers of Islam in the U.S.A. and Canada to attack people in soft targets like shopping malls.

I could care less how bad his life was or is. There is no excuse for what he is doing. He's putting the police in a very difficult position. He's obviously a danger to his neighbors and everyone else so they have to apprehend him. I guess waiting him out may be the best option right now as long as he can't shoot at his neighbors from his home. I truly doubt they will be able to take him alive. I doubt he wants that. He wants them to kill him."

The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS. 

Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.

"thoughts worth considering: 

 Trump's family is moving in on this office.  Ivanka and the boys attended all interviews for potential candidates to serve T's office.  She and her husband are now asking for choice positions in the cabinet.  They will work in the west wing to avoid the law prohibiting this.  
Draining the swamp looks like it got lost somewhere: The people sitting in ready to take their positions are 14 billionaires.  They surely have a sound grip on what the people need/want.  If the Russians truly hacked the DNC/HRC/Podesta........then why haven't the CIA showed that?  They did in another case a couple of years ago. Assange has stated over and over that it was a whistleblower who was fed up w/the corruption of HRC (me too!)

What amazes me today the most is how I keep hearing how T is violating this and that and NO ONE DOES ANYTHING.  The repuglicans are worse than the slugs democraps and all of us?  why like idiots we fight among ourselves arguing on who's stupider"

"Define 'counter-terrorism'.  

Then decide whether Osama bin Laden's attack was the beginning or whether Iran and Hezbollah on the US Embassy in Lebanon in 1983 was the beginning.  Or the 1972 Olympic games was the beginning.  

Or was the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and his confederates the beginning?  

Was President Clinton's 75  cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan in  August of 1998  the beginning of our response?

Homosexuals are also a diverse group. You're doing the same thing with homosexuals and it doesn't matter if you socialize exclusively with medical professionals, to the extent they agree with your ignorant rhetoric they don't belong in the medical profession. 
Minority groups, including sexual minority groups, experience discrimination in many aspects of social life and it definitely has an impact on disease and mortality. The bigotry of people like you contributes to this state of affairs."
"The Trump phenomenon just illustrates, to me, how easy the electorate is to dupe. Their support of Trump shows how short sighted they are, how susceptible to propaganda they are and how lazy they are. It takes a little time,  but the truth isn't so hard to get to. The genius of the Republican party is accusing the other guy of doing what they are in reality doing and deflecting blame every where but where it belongs. In general, it is the Republican party and it's rich patrons, the Oligarchy, that is to blame for the countries woes. However, it is an ignorant and naive electorate that shares the blame for electing these errand boys to run our affairs and for not getting past their visceral responses to dog whistle politics. The Republican party wins votes through fear, prejudice, hate mongering and lies...it's all they can do as they have no real policy positions to offer that will make America work for everyone."

"Trump is a traitor to the United States of America. He willingly accepted help from Putin's Russia where political opponents and journalists are killed and which stole a large piece of a sovereign Ukraine. Putin is estimated to have ammassed $85 billion since becoming president. He is a cleptocrat and dictator....and propelled Trump to president-elect. As I write this I think of many the members of my mother's family who fought for the United States of America during WW2....only for their descendants to see this same country elect a fascist. Why? Were your educations so bad that you don't know enough to recognize it? Of her cousins and uncles and aunts who remained in the Soviet Union when my mother's Protestant  parents and grandparents emigrated to this country in 1905, only two survived their exile to Kazakhstan. The czars, the leaders of the Soviet Union and Putin: all tyrants. Think again about this traitor Trump."

Talib might be a bit nuts, but he cares about the team, is a great player, and did the right thing this time. I loved that he pulled that receiver's idiotic bling cord last year. And he hasn't shot his own foot yet this season, so he might even be team mvp by the end, who knows. He seems a bit humbled after the stupid own toe shoiting. He's better than Davis, who struggles covering TE's."

"Motley my answer to your legitimate question is ...

1. The value of teaching and learning algebra in high school isn't about specific job requirements at all. It's about learning how to learn, how to juggle concepts, and how to jump out of the tangible now and then to step back and see things in theory. 

2. It's also about giving high school kids options for the future, instead of predetermining for them, when they are barely 14 or so, what they can and can't do. 

Story: One of my high school friends was a ""dumb kid"" in the ""dumb class"" who would have been the first one cut out of algebra if he or the educators had been given that as a choice. It turned out he was just a late bloomer. He ended up acing college, going to medical school, and becoming a doctor. He got to laugh later, happily, at the ""dumb"" determination that he had to put up with. And he was a really good doctor."

"Miss Moore sounds like one of the 30,000 standing army Barack Obama has assembled thru corrupt international money to turn this country into a Marxist banana republic. Freedom is not stealing another persons money to pay for your pet projects and an income tax is a form of slavery that we forget but our forefathers knew so well. Since the top 10% of the population pay 70% of all taxes and the bottom half of the country pay ZERO income taxes these arguments are idiotic are only based on contrived emotion and lack any critical thinking. Another point Miss Moore forgets is that corporations don't pay taxes, their customers do, corporate taxes are just hidden taxes on each of us and cause our jobs to go overseas. 
Ya gotta love her ""Virtue Signaling' tho, it so easy to manipulate the masses."

"Like Pitts I won't point out all of Obama's failures on many important issues today.  As a white person I'll just offer comments involving race .  Obama , as the first black president , had the opportunity to bring the races together . It didn't require votes in congress or new laws.  Instead of bringing us together he divided us based on the color of our skin . When incidents hit the front page he always sided based on color---supporting blacks . Instead of acting like everyone's president and calling for calm he fanned the flames of racism . In the D. C. black break-in case he said "" police acted stupidly "" painting police across America in a bad light . In Florida , instead of calling off the lynch mob he said if he had a son he's look just like the victim .  In Furguson , instead of letting police do their job he called in the Fed's . In Baltimore and Furguson rather than strongly calling for calm he allowed black thugs to steal and burn.  Race relations sank thanks to Obama."

"B~
The local police department is a microcosm of the U.S. Military. In fact, they're just as ineffective and outdated. The military, who our finest like to imitate, can't wage the battle where the enemy is, or how the enemy dictates the terms of engagement. The cops look like a pompous military unit, but are defeated by guerilla tactics like nomad bands of thugs on an isolated trail. Sometimes I think our leaders lack the imagination and willpower to creatively use their resources in an effective way.
I'm sorry for the misery this creates for innocent neighbors, but the police could easily clean this up with small undercover units actively enforcing public safety. The police department is lazy, and by their passive/aggressive position are just as guilty as the criminals.
Those bullys better hope a vigilante with c.c. permit and a salty attitude doesn't patrol that trail. He might just take the cops up on their offer. ""YOU FEEL LUCKY PUNK???WELL, DO YA???"""

"Well I have ""deigned"" to answer.

Just in case you missed it: The answer is that the ends do not justify the means. Rape does not justify murder. Go after the rapist and give him the death penalty if you wish--but the child conceived did not rape the women. Therefore the child does not deserve to die for something he/she had nothing to do with.  Incest does not justify murder.  The health of the mother does not justify murder.  Doctors should do all they can to save both.

Now, sir, do you care to answer my question? My question is this:

If you would not support anti-abortion legislation if exceptions were made for rape, incest, or direct health of the mother, what does rape, incest or direct health of the mother have to do with anything?"
"No foreign enemy of America is ever going to attack Trump. He's the best thing they could hope for. A bigly ignorant, lying buffoon who's dragged down American stature in the world from 64% to 22% in six months.

If Trump wanted, he could have simply send the agreement to the Senate to be ratified as a treaty - where it would have died because of all its flaws, including with blue votes. 

As for the politics, as stated before, I am interested in the media coverage and how everything Trump does gets interpreted through a certain caricature and with a healthy helping of double standards and hypocrisy. 

Trump is a conspiracy nutter and has no introspection - well look at Ms Clinton's latest comments where she even blames the DNC data operation and mainstream media.

Quite honestly, I don't understand that level of stupidity. The GOP has been trying to do exactly what they've been doing for years. Trump completes a political trifecta again as bush did. Paul Ryan is giggling himself to sleep every night. They will do EXACTLY what they've been promising they would and only a stupid voter would not vet their own candidate at LEAST as much as their opponent."
"This is PRECISELY the sort of supercilious, hubristic drivel that fuelled the rise of Trump.
Way to go...."
stop yelling.  your comments are obnoxious
"Well here's some lyrics from one of his most recent hits ""Rap God"":

I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
You're witnessing a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy

Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano

But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

One for good measure:
Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not"
"As I read through the first ~50 comments I saw a lot of ignorance being displayed. Yes, Trump is/was controversial. So is/was Hillary.  I took the historical perspective and voted for Trump.  Clinton's baggage had too many skeletons in it.  I'll not list all of them here. Suffice to say, she was a loser."
"Wow, Tinky Winky, you are comparing the conservative Catholics to ISIS and the Taliban.  Thank you for providing evidence of the anti-Catholic hatred ironically found on this forum."
Easier to shoot loose dogs that attack innocent citizens. So yes ur right
"It was lovely to watch informed, educated, intelligent and experienced professionals call Little Donny Trumplethinskin an idiot and a liar in Congress and on national television.  Little Donny is a fool and an idiot."
"retired, AND another reason EWEB prices are high is because of the repeated,  ignorant decisions that management makes ,  like the SECRET DOCUMENT with Seneca Co. that is costing  the ratepayers $25 MILLION.............."
"Of course the liberals are cheating, it's what they do,
Thank the liars in the media for foisting this corrupt and incompetent pack of fools upon us.
If not for their lies we would still have the best PM in the last 50 years still in office."
"So Trump is going to kill us all with his environmental policies ?  This is getting just a bit much, will these people stop at nothing ? Let's shut off all the power plants, stop driving cars and trucks, stop growing and processing food and let everybody starve to death. How about that Dwight, sound like a good solution ?"
"These guys are so transparent it hurts. Now that their bumbling Electoral Minister has been caught up, suddenly the law bears re-writing according to that babbler McCallum. What a bunch."
"Actually , Trump is going to get more support. People are tired of the left and the racist Bigots in the media. CNN, ABC are the worst scum on the planet. Just like 2 months before the election poles and people said Trump has no chance. But people can't stand how racist the dems have become and how much cheating they do. Just last week we found out the only state Hilary won was California and we found out she got a few million votes from dead people. Thats how pathetic the dems have become."
"Tweeting From the Safety and Comfort of His Golf Resort In New Jersey,

What a vacuous buffoon he is."
Is HiLIARy so dumb she does not realize the reason she lost was her?
"Wits?

Our PM is a complete moron who needs Butts to spoonfeed him his lines.

Why is he the worst attending PM in the House of Commons in recent history? Because he can't speak off the top of his head in Question Period and struggles without rehearsed lines so the Liberals purposefully find reasons for him to leave Canada."
"""The force tweeted a warning telling people in the area to run to safety, hide and then call police if it is safe to do so.""

Still wonder why your country is a favorite target?  Generations before us would fight a bully, this generation tells us to hide and hope for the best.  Run, hide, tell is about as pathetic as it gets.  We no longer have to worry about the terrorists winning, they've already won when the best advice is hiding."
Being used only by the democrats... Over 80% of black voters vote D.... Look where it has gotten them...
"Trump wooed them and screwed them.. The morning after, his supporters are trying to tell themselves that he still loves and respects them."
"The IRS is a criminal organization, another tentacle like the ""Federal"" Reserve. America's KGB."
"Trump is a wonderful hypocrite.  Cartoonishly hypocritical even.  I do however find it ironic that Milbank seemed to unknowingly mock Democrat's hypcorisy as well with the paranthetical gibe ""(no taco bowl"".  We all remember the leaked DNC email referring to their Latino outreach as a ""taco bowl"".  I'm assuming this was not done on puropose.  Either way, well played!"
"A Phobia is an unrealistic fear, I think fear of the Muslim invaders is perfectly rational."
"They ( liberals ) are trying to destroy our freedom by divide and conquer. They are implementing racism on all sides where there is none. Did anyone notice its white liberals doing this? They are stoking the fires of racism to gain votes for the democratic party. The democrats, antifa, are pimping the black man to do their bidding. They are using you. They are using us all. They are practicing the same technique they have used to topple governments all over the world DIVIDE, AND CONQUER. Unity is their worst enemy, and the media is their machine gun."
"If cheating is part of the game, yes the Grifter and Liar won."
"Greed, Ignorance -- Rochester NY has a homicide rate (25 per 100,000) almost 15 times higher than Canada.  Maybe Canada has a lower rate because of all those PNG jobs."
"Oh, so basically hotels have been legally SCAMMING the HELL out of gullible and accepting (especially the Japanese, who meekly accept) tourists for YEARS and are now afraid an extra $3/night will end their gravy train???

"You are right Phil Kidd, and whoever the library employee was should be disciplined for saying that to you. Besides the stupidity and ugliness of the remark, the employee was ""on the clock"", and it is outrageous to think that the individual thought they had the liberty to make that kind of comment to a patron. 
Intolerance and lockstep thinking coming from the ""left"" is just as corrosive and damaging to democracy as it is coming from the ""right""."
"Quotes like these make the writer come off as a moron.

""Certain chemicals derived from cannabis may kill tumour cells in a Petri dish, but so does bleach."" - Really? You're comparing marijuana with bleach... How much weed does it take to kill someone - how much bleach?

When referencing high potency oils, ""At these levels, ""you're going to make [patients] completely psychotic and sedated.""

Reefer madness much? People are on dilaudid or other opiates when they're at the end of life stage. If they want some strong oils then it's their choice. Marijuana will be legal in less than 1 year, and this hysteria about high potency marijuana needs to end. 

Think of it this way, if you have 5% beer you can drink 8 beers and get the equivalent amount of alcohol in 355ml of 40% liquor.  Who's going to stop you..."
"""My bet is he is an angry White Supremacist. Look at his arrest records. He could be looney tunes too.""

Yeah, like that crazy guy who shot up all those Republicans at that baseball game.  Or the lunatic who shot and killed 50-some in Orlando, or the crazy people who shot and killed those people in San Bernardio.

Darned angry White Supremacists!  We wouldn't have these terrible tragedies if everyone were a registered Democrat of a non-pinkish-beige color!"
"The joys of being single. I get more taxes taken out.

Why do I care? Because 80% of $2,000,000 is a crap load more than 80% of $60,000. It must suck to only have $1,600,000 to live on."
"Wouldn't it  just be too funny if Oprah Winfrey ran for the Democrats in their next election and became POTUS. Those Trumpsters would sure have their knickers in a twist. A woman and a black woman at that. Lordy, Lordy."
"Will they be shutting down the afro-centric schools, or LGBT only schools?  How about the indigineous only schools in the TDSB?  

If this is about 'equality' and diversity then these costly accommodations need to be scrapped immediately as well, since they are nothing but forced segregation disguised as diversity and equality.

Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.  Hey TDSB, look at Zimbabwe and Venezuela, communists have killed millions and contrary to SJW beliefs, Communists have a very corrupt .001%, and those regimes weren't pretty at all."
"In addition to being a narcissistic sociopath, Trump also appears to have obsessive compulsive disorder.  Fascinating how he spends so much time focused on old news and not so much on actually problem solving."
"“I am not a racist,” Leitch said 

Wrong.  And your burglar sounds like raccoons."
"These intolerance's are about disgust. Nazi's were disgusted by the Jews. Muslims are disgusted by infidels.
In Canada many Christians are disgusted by drug users, sex before marriage, gays even free speech.
Religion breeds narcissism and disgust for the 'other.' Putting people in prison because they disgust you is not much different then violence against them. Of course, we should be disgusted by genuine crimes and violence and even look at the mirror we hold up for others."
Jay Ornat comes across as a complete dick.....I won't watch that dick....
"39.5 per cent of Canadian voters showed that they were both dumb and desperate on October 19, 2015."
"You're right, Arnold was the prosecutor not the defense attorney.  And, as you mention, that is even more ironic......or in terms of using good judgment...moronic."
All loose cats whether feral or with collars should be put down when caught. These apex predators kill billions of song birds and mammals annually. The selfishness of humans letting them loose to destroy much more valuable and rare species is akin to the disgusting habits of smokers that throw their flaming trash from car windows. This planet doesn't stand a chance of supporting us with our horrible behaviors .. and maybe that's a good thing for the rest of the universe.
Jones is another ignorant. The US flag code says to stand with your hand over your heart during the anthem. Couple weeks ago he stood and locked arms with his players. His hand was not over his heart. He was disrespecting the flag as much as anyone who has ever knelt.
Dinerstein is a anti poor ......anti black ...person
"The biggest hoax of all is that you are still trying to peddle this nonsense. Russia got involved in a robust disinformation campaign of what you like to call ""fake news"" and which you apparently still believe, given your incorrect posts on the uranium issue. The campaign of lies, leaked DNC emails that at the end of the day contained really nothing that lived up tot eh GOP lying hype, and other disinfo efforts and collusion turned the tide of opinion away from Hillary, who otherwise was easily the single most qualified candidate to run for president in many years. ""B-b-b-b-ut her emails!!"" Sad for America that we're stuck with this careless rudderless buffoon as president. This is what Putin wanted. He's destroying America from within."
So we have to put up with these useless parasites once again - who pays this time?
"Simpler....

Bathrooms should be based upon physical anatomy not gender.  Penis one side...vagina the other.  
Got both? Select one and stick with it.  It's not about how you feel inside or how you dress..but about what you have.

Anatomy is less erroneous than gender."
"It would be enlightening to know just what perceived or actual slight turned Maureen Down, an acid-tongued scorpion, against the Clintons in the first place, but here she dances vituperatively on their political graves. Take heed your enemy, Chelsea!

The history books of the future will portray the Obama administration as the forces of light engaged in a sinister battle with the forces of darkness. Overall, Obama led the nation through relatively comfortable times, at least from my perspective. I will have to find out how to prosper under a new leader who, at this point, is a pig in a poke. With emphasis on the PIG."
I'd like to see you have time to pull a gun out when a moose jumps out of heavy cover right onto your back. A word of advice: Don't call people idiots until you know the full story.
They should have Brock'd out with the cocks out!
"Yes, maybe I am a prat. Just to clarify....given SA's history, it can be argued that the white population (collectively) lacks the moral authority to pass judgement or criticise the current government. This is not to say that the critiques and judgements are not valid, but when coming from white quarters it can be perceived to lack credibility. The views of ""black"" commentators should be given as much exposure as possible - whether or not they are in favour or critical of the current situation in SA. Their voices should be given preference."
"I agree that she should be removed from Cabinet , but your comment is offensive and sounds like a dog whistle of racism"
"ex PM of canada MADE SURE he will Screw Up the canadian Taxpayer.
11 Million $$$ for this guy and another 9 Million for duffy.
So canadian taxpayer still PAYS harper AKA LUCIFER $180,000 pension on top of the MILLIONS $$$ he gets in KICK Backs from the different groups that RECEIVED FREE TAXPAYER money (OIL< BANKS< PHARMA ) to name a couple.
This makes canadians some of the MOST STUPID people on earth !!!!!!!!!"
"Merkel's immigrant policy that was rammed down everyone's throats has destroyed Europe.

That is why he is so popular 
This is why the left hates him."
"It's getting more and more like industry-run government. No checks and balances. This is what Aldous Huxley wrote about. How does it feel Trump-Serfs? You have brought ruin to our planet with your selfish, low-brow whinings! You have no clue about the natural world. Clueless Cornflakes is a good label for your kind."
"For the Feds part, the Carbon Tax IS revenue neutral, it is up to the provinces to see that it stays that way. That is why Brad Walls comment about it was hypocritical."
Wwwaaaaaa..... mommy.... wwwaaaa.... USA is turning away from the Marxist/liberalism and we can't stop the Trump Train of Alt Modernism.  WAAA..  change my diaper ... I just sheez on myself. - Carly Bernstein
"FEMA was still involved in helping Katrina victims almost 10 years after the hurricane. As usual, twittler has absolutely no idea what he's talking about, other than he's not very keen on helping non-white people. Because he's a racist. A huge, ugly, hate-filled racist. One of the worst in the history of the planet."
He looks pathetic and needs to retire.  I agree that ego and the need for cash are driving his staying in the ring.
"What is illegal about President-Elect wanting his own private line with Russian counterpart?

All this Democrat mud-slinging is sour grapes, and will weaken the Presidency and the USA. 

America emerged as a second rate power after 8 years of Obama, and a third rate power in 8 years if Democrats keep on weakening Trump further. 

Forget about Trump impeachment. He is no dumb Nixon. In anycase, after his 8 years Trump will emerge richer that Bill Gates. Now that is smart politics."
"Identity politics at it's Apex: 
No substance needed, no thought required; just be the correct leftist race/gender combo and the media will coerce the throng to laud you. The throng doesn't have brains either"
"Ms. Hill's agenda is obviously racially motivated, referring to the president as a ""white supremacist"", and calling on all the ""black and brown"" folks to boycott the Cowboys. Are there no white, red, or you name it colors who deserve to join the boycott? ESPN has dug its own grave by hiring and letting loose the results of the so called ""higher education"" journalism graduates. These talking heads were taught that in order to be successful, and stand apart, they must make a name for themselves. These days, that means being political, and what better way to perpetuate their notoriety, correct or not, than to propagate their personal version of unfair race relations."
Why did they ask/pay this piece of human garbage to perform.  He is a racist pig who needs to go back to Mexico and practice his hate there.
"Yes, but equally the vast uninformed, mostly guys like you who don't know what they are talking 'bout, which yours truly has pointed out again and again.  Shall we refresh?  Nah, you look silly enough already.

Yeah, the fact that you even posted this nonsense, it makes my point, drives it home.  You simply do not know.  Stick to trying to insult, it suits."
"Ukrainians were,  and some today still are,  anti-Semitic. 

In World War 2 ,  many thousands of Ukrainians helped the Germans to  kill  six million Jews. 

The fact that that Ukrainians  did not like Russians then and now  is  irrelevant. 

 They acquiesced to and facilitated the murder of millions of Jews."
Sure he did you bumbling buffoon.
"As a supporter of the American enterprise I am astound at their stupidity (let alone lack of morality) in dealing with the Kurds. The Kurds hold an unconditional allegiance to the West and have instituted a form of government that is closer to a democracy than any other government of the surrounding shitholes (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey). American support for them is a smart and moral imperative."
"dennism, you absolutely do not have one ounce of substantive thought in your head or you are woefully incapable of translating it into words. Your ""poking fun"" at persons for liking their own posts is quite annoying and very uncharitable. I've found that to be true of most liberals. When they can't intelligently respond to views they disagree with, they always reach for the straw man, which in your case, is very uncharitable and un-Christ like."
"Sorry, troll feeding time is over."
Frump is a bully and coward. Our delegation will stay silent and tomorrow will bring another stupid comment by Frump.
"Every time I read your column, I want to kill myself."
"Bernstein is embarrassing himself. Woodward, his better half, and a radical liberal himself, just blasted the ""smug"" media and declared that ""fair mindedness is essential if you want people to trust you."" He was essentially blasting Bernstein and gang.

Bernstein's idiotic declaration is like saying science should establish a new scientific method if scientists don't like certain test results.

The media's job -- is to do their job -- and report the facts.  If you don't report the facts, evenly and accurately, the public has no use for you. And the public HAS no use for Bernstein. He's turning into an irrelevant windbag."
"Why wouldn't I?  If fact I did, because it is true, I'm a great tipper."
"Our heritage or race is getting old? Wow, is that what you talk about at those rallies of white guys who can't comprehend beyond the third grade?"
I expect this kind of sedition from a freaking rat that was raised by a couple of degenerate communists. Hey Carl how'd that Ukranian genocide of 1933-34 work out for your traitorous parents. What do you expect from a disloyal dirtbag.
"So a union pin is OK, but not a poppy?! Where do they hire these clueless people, and how on earth do they ever get promoted to VP? Unbelievable."
"Nope.  

An apologist who bows and genuflects to inferiors  when nothing requires an apology at all is still a cowardly, whiny little slug."
Thank for whitesplaining and fat shaming. God knows  we wouldn't want to elect a man who gropes ugly women.
"Krauthammer: Trump's dishonesty, hypocrisy, cynicism, racism and cruelty don't hurt him in the least with his base.  Haven't you noticed how he turns all of the above up when things are looking down for him?  He was elected by skillfully manipulated lies, fear and hate.  They will always be his play again whenever he's in trouble."

TROLL"
"And all of this is offered without proof.... The CIA won't comment but politicians jump in and cry foul......! Obviously, no country wants outside interference in an election but - ""whoever"" was leaking e-mails, what did they expose? A bunch of political, underhanded garbage, actually disgusting with Democrats behind the controls. Bernie Sanders, a likeable guy, honest among other things. But nope, the fix was in - for Bernie..... And the part about Obama not wanting to interfer? That's baloney! I've never seen a sitting president (and his wife) so involved campaigning for a candidate - they were bending over backwards, out everyday on the hustings......!"
"Your defense is off  the mark
I didn't call him a terrorist 
I said he's pro Muslim terrorist immigration 
His debt with congress doubled under Obama 
Both at fault 
Obama was leader 
Pro partial birth abortion 
Anti traditional marriage 
Your a racist toward Christian values
Scratch a democrate and find not racist but satanic principles"
What about family and friends of these mass murderers?  Why are they allowed to stay? Lots of them knew and did nothing.  Do we really want these kind of people here in the aina?  Say no to mainland mentality clowns chimp and whapson.
I hate this PM but this is because of the previous ASSHOLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Family Trusts are often testamentary trusts, bequeathed at death from tax-paid money.  There is no tax dodge here.  Instead of bequeathing money into the hands of minors and infants, a Trust is formed where ALL income each year must be distributed to beneficiaries by a responsible person - income remaining inside the trust is taxed at a the highest rate.  Trust tax rules have recently changed to become much less attractive from a tax perspective.  Sheer is a hypocrite on this one.  And, anyone can form such trusts on death.

Farmers and businesspeople who have large pools of capital captured in companies can do an estate freeze and transfer the newco to family members.  There are may ways to skin a cat.  

The idea that the proposed changes will cause every fat cat to suddenly freeze in their steps and take a big tax hit is ridiculous.  Anyone smart enough to form a personal corporation to sprinkle wealth is smart enough to find many new ways forward that will work under proposed laws."
"So at least two of Trump's KGB handlers dropped by the state and the locals bowed and scraped.

Disgusting."
"This woman is a menace!! Another example of violent career criminals who have no intention to change and will continue to hurt anyone they  feel like hurting.  Get this lowlife scum off our streets!! WTF is wrong? People, wake up! Our justice system is a joke. Punishment for crime is a joke. Repeat offenders are a joke. Sentencing is a joke. Bail is a joke. Bottom line, people the joke is on us! We are the ones that pay for these asshats. We are the ones they hurt. We are the ones that live afraid to go certain places at certain times out of fear of these people. Nothing will change or get better until we realize our justice system, laws, punishments and how victims are treated is addressed and completely changed. When is enough enough? When are we going to take back our city and protect our people?? 
I am so frustrated by the way American society has changed into a haven for criminals and victims don't get justice. By God forbid we don't give sexual predators & rapists free lawyers!!"
"Libturds love to spin words. Just like they do when they blend legal immigration with illegal immigration. 

The evil doer in this church shooting had no legal right to be in possession of that fire arm...PERIOD!  The heroes did have a legal right to posses their guns. And thank goodness that they did. They carnage would have been tremendously worse.

So why are libturds always so against a person’s right to defend themselves and others???  Funny thing is libturds are perfectly fine with killing innocent and defenseless babies within a mother’s womb."
Typical white colonizer rhetoric.
"Meanwhile, lefties beat up speakers and riot in Berkeley but that is OK because they are lefties.
The media is frighteningly dishonest.  What about the story of Trump releasing classified info to the Russians?  Turns out Trump can declassify anything he wants.  Furthermore, he was advising the Russians of plots that could bring down a Russian airliner.  Remember one went down last summer.  Only the NYT revealed who the originator of the info was, so the NYT is the one that really released sensitive info.  Any retractions in the Amazon Washington Post or New York Times?  I don't think so.
Finally, this reporter should know that sticking a microphone in anyone's face in Montana can get you into a world of pain.  Try it yourself, Mr. 3 Names, in any bar in Montana or Alberta."

"Spot on.

Why accede to your own extinction when your negotiating partner is merely a proxy for foreign organizations whose goals are to exterminate Israel.

Until civilization, free speech and democracy happens in the Middle East, no further progress can be made.

Indeed, why would the Israelis want to negotiate at all.."
Wrong country.  The last thing we need is more stinkin' Canadians coming to Anchorage every weekend .

"Yeah, a partisan public service is not a problem. Right... The stupid and uniformed voters need to be saved by the self appointed guardians. A Venezuelan approach to governing, no? And Cuban, Russian, Chinese, etc. Is that what we need since the democracy failed so miserably in America? BTW, all things being equal, substitute Trump with Hillary and this article would never be published, let alone written. Partisan journalism seems to be a problem as well, it would seem."
They are like energizer bunnies high on stupid. Running in circles tossing one ridiculous idea out after another. ATWOOD BLDG. Simple.
"Tired tired tired. We went to Christmas in Spenard  last year and it's just too much now. I don't care for Trump but I can't listen to hours of stolen jokes, shitty powerpoints, and increasingly bitter one sided bias. When you refuse to include both sides of the political extremes in your satire, it's just a circle jerk of close minded people agreeing with each other. Left, right, red, or blue.

Honestly why hasn't Dr. Demento's estate not sued this guy? Are Alaskans that desperate for entertainment that they yet again settle for third rate copycats? Have they been doing it so long they forgot who he copies?"
I'm glad he's back on the job. This crybaby should have followed his orders to begin with. What did she think he was going to do...pat her on the head???

"This is just another poor article from a journalist who does not have a clue.  Pure sensationalism, not worth the space it is written on; feeding group frenzy.  Why don't they hire qualified people who have critical thinking ability.  Look at things in perspective.  First time buyers and millennials are struggling to buy their first homes.  Is that any different from 30 years ago when first time buyers where paying 15% interest and got a fraction of the real estate their parents bought?  This debate about the housing crisis is 85% garbage, written by people with a sense of entitlement and no perspective.   Our politicians are just lapping it up, because with their fat pensions, they only want re-election, economy be damned.  Where is the balance in journalism these days?  These guys are just fear mongering fools."
And the GOP will lie to you and then stab you in the back like always.
You are sadly misinformed but then that's pretty typical of leftist posters here.  These propagandists were there for one reason only.  These folks are in no danger of 'losing' anything more than a few days sleep at home for breaking the law.   They do get a complicit media to lie and spread the lie that they might lose their healthcare.  It's transparent to anyone with a brain.   But uninformed and intentionally ignorant leftists just keep buying the lies.   It's sad really.   A lobotomy would leave them with more critical thinking skills than they are exhibiting here.
"Matthew, 

You did a good job trotting out the NRA talking points as to why there isn't a national gun database. Then cjg pointed out how funny it is when you take that particular right wing logic nugget and apply it to another database. All of a sudden a national electronic database, of Muslims makes so much sense, but a national database of guns is unheard of. 

It is 2016. Two thousand and sixteen, and you have a group of Americans who seriously believe we shouldn't have a computer database of guns. You have people who think it's totally sensible. I imagine these folks put the lead additive in their cars and drive to work, get out the type writer ribbon and clack away in between trips to the mimeograph. It's absolutely embarrassing. Get with the damned 21st century and create the database. 

I'm so damn sick of these NRA cowards who have been clamoring on for decades about how people are coming for their guns, and no one ever bleeping does. Obstructionist, cowardly ludites."
You don't know what the hell you are talking about!  Have you paid attention to the latest headlines?  My husband is one of the Sears retirees losing a pension that he has paid into for 28 years!  More and more private companies are going this way.  Get your head out of the sand!
Walker is an idiot.  Calling the Assembly to blame the Legislature.  How lame.  Why not have a backbone and owe up to his mistakes?  Why didn't he spend time explaining why he won't significantly cut state government or put an end to his economically unfeasible and wasteful gas line fantasy project?  Walker can't be recalled soon enough.

"""Our Republican friends went in to a hissy fit when someone, not a Catholic, emailed John Podesta calling for reforms in the Catholic Church."" - Silliness, to call an objection to the Democrats starting phony ""catholic"" front groups in order to sway voters a ""hissy fit"", is more about ridicule than a legit objection. Perhaps it hits too close to home here at NcR, after all they have been ordered by their bishop to remove the word ""catholic"" from their name...Now lets look at the violent ""hissy fit"" our Democrat friends are engaging in on the streets of Democrat cities across the nation!"
"Clean out all these incompetent inhumans, and get the Rainbow Friends to operate the organization! This is a long-standing grievance and should have been addressed long ago but, when taxpayer money is involved, the parasites feeding frenzy moves in, then, the politicians start barking and nothing gets done to clean up the poop piles !"
"Candy coat it all you want.

Your outrage is still hypocritical."
"Cultural competence says Jesus would have told them to 'go and sin no more'. Homosexuality was never accepted in Jewish or Christian teaching.  It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts. But the liberals love to kill the messenger, because they hate the Message."
Because the dems are full of sh....
"This is hilarious (as in Hillary). There is no chance that Trudeau thinks for himself. And to cover up his illegal and immoral behaviour, he calls it ""lobbying"" instead of fundraising? Does he think Canadians are that stupid?"
"Thanks for the info - however it was about that time 1984 that FP&L went from being a world class leader in solar to the pathetic anti-renewable, exploitative, politically toxic company that it is now.  SOMETHING changed."
"If someone's making that kind of coin and actually paying 27%, they're idiots.  There are so many loopholes to hide the money.  The only way you'll get the rich to actually pay ""their fair share"" is to completely restructure the tax code and either do a flat tax or a national sales tax with no write-offs.

No, I'm not in favor of huge taxes.  I am in favor of huge budget cuts and a balanced budget law, though.  'Course that'll never happen."
No class!  Ripping the kids off?  Disgusting.
"So, if ""his ill informed followers will eat this up like, etc"" I 'd say that makes him a fairly clever clown."
"Charessa: nothing in your letter has any reference to any kind of evidence that what you believe is true.  It's all your opinion.  What are you basing your opinion on?  We had hurricanes when Obama was the president and he totally bought into climate change.  But he was political, hence had ulterior motives. Don't be an idiot. Get off the climate change bandwagon. Follow the money."
People need to understand the facts surrounding this new mine plan before they pass judgement. The 'NO' movement are saying that they'll oppose the mine no matter what?  That's just plain old dumb. Bet they all have nice jobs and are sitting in nice houses

"Nice recipe for hate. Thanks, G&M. Why not pick on apex predators in the food chain while you're at it. Damn sharks! How dare they oppress phytoplankton!"
"wonder what that has to do with anything?  If I recall, the white Quebecker showed up at a mosque to kill Muslims."
"We may get a new president if the old one dies, or is removed by the 25th amendment.  I don't believe he is in the best of health. I have no idea what point you are trying to make with your second statement.  You republicans are in control and you should be passing legislation that you deem important.  For the most part you haven't passed anything.  I find it laughable that you idiots complained about Obama care for 7 years and yet couldn't come up with the votes to pass anything.  What jokes the republicans  have become.  

I realize the Donald will never show us his tax returns as then he will be shown to be the fraud he is.  But since he complained about Obama's birth certificate, I can complain about his tax returns.  I could be demanding to see his birth certificate to prove his father was not an Orangutan"
"The press is the enemy. They have an agenda. Disgusting. They are fake news. Nothing they say is to be trusted. They have put our country in danger. Treasonous! I will never trust those bunch of pompous jerks, again."
"Trump, the leaker of the free world, wants an investigation into leaks! After leaking very highly classified intelligence to the Russian spies whom he invited into the Oval Office without consulting U.S. intelligence services, after confirming that the allied intelligence service that he betrayed was Israel's (while standing next to the Israeli prime minister), after disclosing highly classified information regarding the location of U.S. nuclear submarines to the murderous president of the Philippines, Trump wants to investigate leaks! I love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning."
Just imagine hillbilly naked. Woohoo. Fat rolling over fat rolls. Lovely
Another elitist sore loser
"Trumps Leadership Qualifications: 1) He knows how to Twitter, 2)  His tactics emulate those of an accomplished and proficient con artist, 3) He is well versed in being a bully, an intimidator, and bull sh...er, 4) He can act  impulsive, anti-authoritarian, macho, invincible, and invulnerable, and even fatalistic, 5) He knows how to divide and conquer (although his capacity for organization and unification are doubtful), 6) He is willing to  extend his lines of communication and demoralize his staff in the face of superior forces, and 7) When necessary, has the ability to disappear behind a palpable and vile smelling cloud,  8) Over 35 (and of what kind of mind?).  Follow Trump at your risk."
"The people who voted for Trump should have to deal with the negative consequences of their decision. Truth and fact should have the opportunity to kick them square in the teeth so they can no longer fool themselves about the monster they elected President! The only problem is, too many innocents here in the US and around the world will be punished for something they did not do! The Democrats should be selective on the issues they decide to fight for. Healthcare, education, and civil rights would be my choices  for drawing a line in the sand."
"What a piece of GARBAGE! Obviously written by a left wing nut that resents the knowledge, experience and power that comes with getting older. It seems that she (and many other clueless people) think that 'aging', working your way up and being a useful part of society in your 'golden years' is something to be ashamed of.

Being 'old' and part of society is not a dirty word, it's something to be proud of. Remember lady one day you will be an 'old white woman' how you going to feel then?"
The (D)donkeys of the state are a bunch of babies.
"Wait until all those wealthy ""Trumpers"" find out that their wives' Lexus RX crossovers are assembled in Cambridge, Ontario.  A 35% import tariff by the ""Orange One"" would tack on about USD $17,500 to a USD $50,000 car. Canada can retaliate, of course, but why?  Let Trump hang himself.  Also what is to happen to the thousands of American marques' cars and trucks that are assembled in Ontario and shipped  to the U.S. Market.  They are assembled from a lot of U.S. made parts made by, guess who, U.S. workers.  

Another incredibly stupid idea from an incredibly stupid President elected by some really incredibly stupid people.  God forbid the ""Great Groper"" should think anything through.  Stay tuned, the editorial cartoonists will never lack for material with this fool."
"A dumb 4$$ kid and a tweaker, neither of which are known to much intelligence."

"So Chloe's racist, sexist and ageist diatribe isn't hatred but my criticism of her is?  Boo Hoo!  You lost.  Go drown your sorrows looser."
"Oh complete rubbish! Your rhetoric is not only dishonest it's a promotion of misery or death . So now you are putting your bias as having more credibility then licensed medical professionals? That is truly rich beyond belief, no wonder we have the word ignorance in the American language , and thank God it's illegal for non-profession unlicensed ignorant people to practice medicine.

I'm glad to note your use of the word ""engage"" which I will remind you is a verb an action word. Sexual activity aside from victims of illegal forcible activity is a choice. One either chooses to engage in sexual activity or not, regardless if the sexual activity denotes heterosexual or homosexual. Regardless if the sexual engaged activity is largely considered within so called social norms or deviant practices among society. Thereby both heterosexuality & homosexuality are a ""lifestyle"" choice, just as one may choose to be sexually inactive is also a chosen ""lifestyle""."
"""Nevertheless, throughout the entire hearing, the only questioner who seemed off his game was Arizona Senator John McCain.""

McCain  seemed completely confused about Clinton's e-mail issues and Russian meddling/possible Trump campaign collusion.  I felt sorry for the way he was embarrassing himself.  All credit to Comey for not correcting him in a way that would have corrected the record but would have made MCCain look more foolish."
"day by day all normal people wake up and start understanding what a huge stupid mistake they did when they accepted trans and gays... 

just like any other ""minorities"" they will push their agenda and with the help of the state they will bully all the rest in the name of ""tolerance""

the people of Canada deserve it, and more
some of you think this ""protects trans and gays""... wrong
they are no more protected than yesterday... if an evil person wants them to get hurt... they will get hurt

actually this is damaging them beyond repair
as people around wake up in a police state where their language and actions are under constant policing, they will start to see who the enemy is, and they will start to act

like in Europe right now, where at the roots, a growing anti-islam movement is spreading, even as the media and the state regulates more and more against it

it will not only become mainstream, but it will have a devastating effect down the road
bad laws are bad, and stupid"
"“The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get fucked over.”

"What in the world is the author of this article doing quoting St. Catherine of Siena?  Of all the saints in Church's long history, St. Catherine most strongly denounced homosexuality.  I mean, her comments are so severe, I dare not repeat them here.  But don't take my word for it, just do a simple internet search."

"And yet today it's the white supremacists who like your president - the Republican president, the racist president who feeds them. That stink isn't on your relatives, it's on you. It's not the past, it's today, and you seem ok with it."
"Absolute bloody rubbish.
Trump supporters have the attention span of a Goldfish, with half of their working brain cells.
These are people who sent money to Jimmy Swaggart, believe Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11, and believe that Obama was born in Kenya and is a secret Muslim.
Throughout the election they lappped up fake news posted by teenage Bulgarian scammers, and they're certain that Hillary was running a child sex ring out of a Washington Pizza shop.
You and your ilk have utterly no comprehension of critical thought, and will believe anything that your rabid right sites tell you."
Well Trudeau is a secret Muslim
Tafoya. Your family name and you are a giant pile of  fesces.
"Idiot isn't it, ben w?"

Ahhh when the bigots refuse to see their own  bigotry and start calling others bigots.   Riel you take the cake and are no doubt a typical bully type.  If Mr. Dallaire walked in the room and you had the chance to spew your venom we all know you would cower.
"It has worked very well, we are still not a mindless socialist welfare state run by ignorant twits who depend on welfare for their existence."
excellent article.   this was obvious the instant the computer screen was moved to the cell phone.  now most people have a personal 'idiot box' in tow.  a dumbed down society is more easily controllable.
"Why was he carrying a large rifle? And why did he shoot it from a distance?  
Because he's demonstrably stupid and a waste of oxygen.  If only he would have used his toe, to pull the trigger."
"That is utter nonsense.   The Mayor has no authority whatsoever over the council.   The city councilors are elected to their offices by the citizens residing in their wards.   They are the only people that they are accountable to.   And the Mayor has no authority over the City Manager either.   The City Manager only takes direction from votes by the council.   

Again, you reveal yourself to be totally incompetent when it comes to understanding how the Eugene city government operates.  You could not be more ignorant about  how it functions."
Spoken like a true Russian troll.
exactly!  But let us be honest:  Hawaii is dominated by non-whites and Trump racist base will be happy to see Hawaii wiped out.  Trump is a disgrace.

"Why, Mr Bernstein, do you expect President Trump to lay down and take crap from every So called Journalist just like Bush did.?   He answers back, to your bias and lies.  Too bad for you.  Yes it's different and we (the deplorables) are enjoying it."

"I have trouble with a dumb 15 year old kid doing something utterly stupid and the benign educated wisdom of USFS GS 13 and above District Rangers and Forest Supervisors who watch fires,  do nothing,  for days,  while the fire is smoldering in one known snag,  and from that the Biscuit Fire.  This year,  on the same Forest,  a 1/4 acre fire was not suppressed,   for days,   because it was ""too dangerous"" for people on the ground to hike there.  Steep ground.  I guess a 747 with 20,000 gallons of water and a maybe half million dollar price tag for a water drop wasn't worth saving 185,000 acres of forest cover,  the  tree killing burning of part of Oregon's only native coast redwood stand,  with fire through the whole stand.  Oh,  and homes and out buildings,  private property,  destroyed.  

You see,  tort limitations make suing the USFS a peeing into the wind exercise.  It costs more to hire a law firm,  file the papers,  and do the prep work to go to trial,  than any award would pay."

Don't sue the individual... Sue whoever has money... Throw a lawsuit against the wall, it just might stick."

"No Dumb*ss, many people do it. It's a statement instead of having to reply to idiots over and over again."
"Once again a Muslim causes a terrible atrocity and the world still rubs its hands.  Islam, is not a religion and should not be considered one so as to obtain ""religious freedom"" so cherished by the West.  It is an intolerant ""way of life"" that applauds death of all non believers.  A world wide organized crime syndicate comes to mind but under the guise of religion.  Humanity must expel its existence.  Now you know!"
"One thing is for sure Ontario power generation  has made New York and Michigan states
 Great again..   Thanks to Ontario's incompetent and  corrupted liberal party.."
"Blocking the reauthorization of the CHIP program while simultaneously advocating for spending on a flipping border wall is absolutely mind-boggling. There are countless examples of truly boorish, self-centered actions by the GOP, but this one is truly heartless. Tell me, reader: How can you possibly support these people? Because you're worried a brown man might take your guns? I don't know how you can live with yourselves. The Republican party and it's supporters are all traitors, idiots or both."

"Ronna are you delirious?  By making a statement like that you set the advances women have made in leadership positions such as yours back to the dark ages.  With this buffoon in Office we are an embarrassment to America, the GOP, and any other party not to mention what the rest of the world leaders are thinking about how far America has fallen.  “The best place we have ever been?”  You need some serious counseling."

Guess they will be OK if we all cheer when dems are murdered.
"Lizzy Acker you have no idea what you are talking about.  I've eaten at Cracker Barrel Country Stores all over the country. Better than any NW chain restaurants and most other family restaurants. Mediocre is the word I would use for you writing skills. Must be another liberal loser with a computer and a column. If you haven't eaten there then shut up, on second thought don't set foot in there. They need to keep the rift raft out."
More childish nonsense from the PQ.
"I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO WIN ANY FUTURE WARS WE SHOULD ONLY SEND WOMAN, TRANSGENDERS,LESBIANS,GAYS,AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MAKE UP THEIR MINDS, TO THE FRONT LINES. DOING THAT WOULD INSURE THAT WE NEVER LOSE ANOTHER BATTLE.  THE REASON BEING, THE ENEMY WOULD LAUGH ITSELF TO DEATH!"

"""Some of"" - meaning papers published decades ago...

You're basically claiming that the first genital-sore isn't so bad, so why cure the syphilis - it will take decades before it rots your brain right ?"
"A lot of people have new cyber security masters degrees. I don't know why companies won't bring on new talent. It's like they allergic to resumes that don't have 5-10-15-20 years experience in cyber security. So they barely hire when they tout about thousands of openings and needs.

You know why we get hacked all the time by Russia and China...it's because A-our technology infrastructure is super weak. B-they identify cyber talent potential and harness the crap out them. They don't care if you don't have the experience because they will train people up. As a result, they end up with hordes of people that get sponsored to learn and apply network penetration techniques. 

not in America, where the tech employment game is so stupid only a few have the opportunity to apply these skills. Despite advanced STEM degrees. I know nothing can beat experience but we lose and lose hard when those who have it, refuse to train and bring on new talent. Hell, at the very least degrees show aptitude."
"Homosexuality is promoted in schools, Islam is flooding society, provincial and national debts that 200 years of straight prosperity would not be able to pay off. Furthermore, the next century will see the decline of the West and the rise of China - so no prosperity here for a long, long time. It seems to me Canada will not see the turn of the next century."
Another extension.  They just do not want to get rid of the pork.  Should be a clean bill.  Dems and republicans are the worse we have ever had.  Depression is coming.

"Another liberal judge it seems bought and

"From the Wall Street Journal: ""The two sides unveiled business deals they valued at more than $250 billion, but were not actual contracts"".  But of course Walker can't say the words ""Alaska does not have a contract to build my gas line"".  Because that would be telling the truth.  Much better to blow smoke at Alaskans and do a fake happy dance as propaganda for his next election, and so his buddies can keep getting their $550,000 salaries working on the gas line to nowhere project.  Pathetic."
"Not sure what you mean by that.  Is it bizarre that the rich will never be rich enough, or that you believe they use their wealth to take care of those less fortunate?  The wealthy (in all countries) are actively planning for the results of AGW (even while denying it is real), insuring they and their friends will be safe and even thrive.  To think otherwise is very foolish."
"This also clearly adds to Trump's racist, white supremacist pedigree.  

Some of the people marching under NAZI flags in Charlottesville (all white) were apparently ""fine people"".

A part black guy, and other black guys, making what are actually a completely legal protest, albeit portrayed and communicated during the ritual of the singing of the US national anthem, is a/are SOB(s).

Trump is co-opting as well as linking the concept of Patriotism to White Supremacy.

Lot's of people do acts that openly ""disrespect"", and sometimes defiile the flag (as others point out, a constitutionally protected act),  Like, for instance, the Nazis in Charlottesville (including the ""fine people"" amongst them) who waived swastika flags in lieu of American Flags.

Trump chose the SOB moniker for blacks.  

He's a racist, White Supremacist.  No doubt about it."
"All this talk about ""PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP"" is MOOT. NO one wants to get INVOLVED in this stinking loser of a project!!!

"I don;t believe it's been established that whites break laws against crack at the same rate as blacks.  In fact, I thought the left's argument was that the crack laws are racist precisely because blacks violate crack laws more often, while powder is the white boys' crime."

I think Mr. Chin is making an attempt at grabbing the spotlight for himself and the Democratic Party but it's a big mistake by upsetting the 'man' and party in control. Either that or his ego exceeds his bounds.  There will be repercussions and Hawaii residents will be the victims of a 'fools folly'.

"I wonder how many more times this guy will be slapped on the wrist, and how many more people he will have to kill before he actually has to serve any serious prison time?

"I will vouch for NY, Cuomo is a liar and is not in compliance!"
"I said I generalized.  As a culture, we certainly accept those deaths and many more as a means of a viable solution to minimal problems.

I sure haven't heard much talk against these wars.   What we shift to is pathetic in comparison.  Some football player kneels when the anthem is being played, or Trump says something stupid on Twitter, or some guy refuses to bake a cake for a gay couple, and the country freaks out. We kill thousands of families and hardly a word said.  That's some prioritization we have going on.  I was born in the 1960's, and those protests are what we should be seeing. 

I've been vocal to my government about this behavior since the 1990's, when I started to realize what we've been doing. My congressmen have been getting an earful.  Tancredo, Coffman, and even Perlmutter disagree and think we're doing the right thing."
I call you a damn fool.
I am pro Obama..but you have a point. I too was pissed off when we sat back and did nothing fearing Russia' response. Now our president elect is Putins puppet.
"Anyone who thinks Russia does not do that is fostering treason right along with Trump, the treasonous President Elect who openly asked for Russian help during the campaign!

And ignore the planted comments in these sections from the Russian cyber-attack establishment.  They are too stupid to be real.  No one could be that idiotic without an agenda."

If anyone wants who is responsible for this to be held accountable they should probably let the police do what they do best and solve the case. There is a reason none of us are law enforcement.... I love Courtney and miss her everyday.... I KNOW for a fact that the police are working hard to bring these people to justice. They have reasons why they operate the way they do and it is all for the greater good. Please let them do their job and just shut up. We owe it to court. RIP baby girl.
"Why are you bringing their race up in your comments? And calling them stupid and ethically and morally challenged?

"Sounds like Butts provided the Health Minister with the new talking points.  So carefully omitted was any reference to the 'deal' that Ontario made with doctors 15 years ago to allow them to incorporate and utilize these loopholes in lieu of doctor's fee increases.  Negotiated in part by none other than Mr. Butts while serving as a key Queen's Park adviser.  He knows that taking this away from doctors is disruptive, and by inference he seems to expect his former employer to pony up the difference (higher fees from provincial revenues).  How hypocritical, Gerry."
Amazing how such an ignoramus can become the President of the United States.  So embarrassing for them.
"Not only are there no statues of Hitler, but Nazi paraphernalia is outright banned throughout the entire country.

Too bad America didnt do the same thing after the Civil War in regards to the Confederate Flag or allowing statues to be put up of the racist generals who lost."
Truth be told hunters are more likely to be mauled then hikers. But either way it sucks for who ever involved and we hope for a quick recovery for both.
"Until there are enough drug and alcohol treatment beds where addicts can get proper medical care, the notion that such prohibitions will reduce substance abuse are a total canard.

I don't need your friends beating on my hood or ice picking my tires.

Anonymity also protects my family from your friends. Cowards often pick on the weak and unprotected.

I also don't want to have to shoot anyone stupid enough to show up at my house with violence as part of your agenda.

"This headline highlights how dumb the majority of Canadians are when it comes to politics:

But Two in Three (65%) Say Trudeau’s Approach to Politics is Good for Canada, and New Government is a Breath of Fresh Air (63%)"

"75% of the NFL is black males, 6% U.S. population is black males, 21% of crime is done by black males, 51% of murders is done by black males. Maybe white fans should take a knee to protest the real problem because it isn't the country or the flag or the police that's causing the problem."

The impetus of these marches:  Many Americans are dumber than a sack of hammers and easily manipulated by propaganda. Where should they be marching?  How about suburban ghettos, with the toughest gun laws, run by Democrat mayors and city councils. Chicago is a perfect example of the real problem. Fifty years of welfare programs and treating black people like victims has created a dysfunctional system leading to hopelessness, crime, and perpetual poverty. Chicago is 32% white, but they commit only 3.5% of the murders. Over 96% of the murders are committed by non-whites. Essentially, it is young black men murdering other black men.  We were done when it became unacceptable to tell the public the truth without being called racist."

The Democrats will do anything to pander for votes. 50% of the Americans who work for a living and are good providers for their family don't need free medical insurance. People on welfare who don't contribute to society will not make America Great Again. What's wrong with enjoying a comfortable life style. What's wrong with being rich. All the Democrats in Congress are rich millionaires. What's good for them is not good for the average American? Why make it harder than it already is by taxing the middle class more so the poor don't have to go to work. The poor need to get of their bum and find a job or suffer the consequences.

If I mouthed off, I got slapped in the mouth. I have never, ever considered murdering anyone for anything. You cannot blame poverty.  You choose to be a P.O.S. or not. These kids have NO conscience.

"Black Lives Matter means just that... that black lives do, indeed, matter. Why is that even controversial to you? You think they don't matter?

The name was derived because 400 years of white supremacist anti-black behavior by a large swath of the majority white America has proven without a shadow of a doubt that many do NOT value black lives. 3/5ths clause for starters. Current neo-Nazi and klan rallies for current perspective. If you don't see racism, you have the luxury of not having to pay attention to it. Black Americans don't have that luxury.

How ironic that on a thread about Trump caping for the KKK and neo-Nazis, your take-away is how ""racist"" the simple, straightforward non-exclusionary phrase, ""Black Lives Matter"" is. It doesn't state that 'black lives matter MORE'. Or 'ONLY black lives matter'. Nope, just ""black lives matter"". 

Eliminating the concept of race is a nice goal for the future, but not feasible when racism is so prevalent. I remind you we have a nazi problem."

He is truly delusional in that he is the biggest obfuscator, obstructionist, 'no commenter,'  conflict of interester, gerrymanderer, truth hider - oh, I could go on and on and on.  Who does he think he is kidding?!   He works for his oil handlers and not the people of Alaska.  If he did, we'd have a sustainable budget years ago.

Trump's a liar. That's why Comey started making these memo's. If this was Hillary or Obama you'd be screaming for his head with all the other internet warriors.

"Evidently you hold Ms. Swift in disdain. Would that you and the others that have jeered her could find her strength and courage. Then perhaps you would see a young woman that was groped in a sexual assault, and who responded very appropriately. Her attacker suffered consequences.

I'm not the least bit opposed to mines, but a giant open pit mine, with a giant lake full of cyanide and other mine waste, will be held back by a giant damn, on the unstable earthquake prone location, right at the head of Bristol bay.

Just admit it. Clinton is so corrupt and dirty that people had to hold her nose to vote for her.    And those same people conveniently go blind to her corruption now that she's the only democrat left.    It's kind of sickening that there are so many idiots that will vote for Clinton DESPITE KNOWING HOW CORRUPT SHE IS AND CONTINUES TO BE.
Nenshi is a pompous and arrogant ***. His Royal Purpleness feels he has the jelly to dictate to all lesser beings. It will be good to see him soundly defeated on his less than stellar record.

Polio/diptheria vaccines are not over-rated at all.  In fact they are necessary so I was putting helmets in the exact same category.  I'll say it again and see if you can catch on THIS time.  Helmets are almost as over-rated as polio/diptheria vaccines.  Now who's the ignorant one?

"I only disagree with liars and idiots. Though in your case I am unsure which applies.
It is not 'largely'. It is overwhelmingly. We do know that. Down to exact measurements. I already explained how we know. Either present scientific evidence disproving the USGS or concede. But clinging to an argument after I utterly debunked it with science is either extreme stupidity or blatant dishonesty. Neither will impress me. Repeating a lie does not make it true."

"My opinion: all the years I have lived and traveled around America I have seen more believers of CHRIST commit more blasphemies of the Laws of that belief than I ever cared to. American's and every other nations culture always feel that the other religion was demons and devil's. Each point the finger and crown themselves as GOD's chosen. But, what I can say as a citizen of this country is that Americans have become,over last 50 odd yrs, a  bunch of sanctimonious, self-stroking, self-righteous hypocrites. Fed by false prophets called preachers who have slept with the government to get rich and social gain and with that has destroyed this nation from within. Demboski/Trump/Palin/Hillary/Bush are the trash legacy this nation has been fed through lies and to me they committed the worse treason. They called it politics as usual. No I'm not afraid of foreign terrorists. These idiots spreading hate, lies and emotional and mental blackmail scare me more.Young people are listening and watching."
"Then let him say he's sorry.  No emotionally mature person would have responded in the way he did.  He has a history of making stupid statements so he doesn't get a pass.

"I think the argument regarding ""black on black murder"" is that they riot in the streets when known criminals (armed or not) are killed. Meanwhile, young adults and kids are literally slaughtering each other and it gets little attention.

My argument is we should worry less about the color and stand strong against all unjustified killings regardless of the race/religion/profession/etc. of the victim and the killer. Focusing only on a single grouping only continues to keep us divisive as a people.

Do we really need to be exclusive? Fine, ""American Lives Matter""."

Now its to late and these stupid self-centered kids lives are over, shattered and destroyed and prison is their future. For what? What manner of evil justifies murdering a 17 yr old kid over weed. To pistol whip him, tell him he's going to die, drive him out and shoot him down in coldblooded premeditated murder. This is a more than a mind can wrap around."

a person convicted of domestic abuse is NOT allowed to have a gun. This psycho slipped through the cracks like so many. Quite frankly it doesn't really matter because guns are quite easy to get.
"After all the sneering about Canadians' financial illiteracy, the article offers little practical advice. How much can the bite of depreciation be reduced through brand selection? Or, is buying a 3-year-old used car a better idea for most people? At how many km/yr do fuel economy features such as hybrid engine become worth the premium price? Let's see some education, G&M, instead of just telling us what idiots we are."
He's having a mental collapse because a four star general keeps pointing out he is full of crap and doesn't know the truth about anything.  You can tell in his facial expressions that he can't accept reality and is starting to have a mental break.  It must be hard for people who believe this white supremacist garbage.  Their heads are jacked and they have a complete false narrative on history.

"It makes complete sense, Kiszla.  You're still an idiot."
"I find it really odd that some companies still try to pretend they have the upper hand when the economy is doing well. I have no idea why they behave like this. I suspect that because the industry overall is driven for whatever reason toward younger people - and try to drive out older workers - that they have almost no memory. Certainly no concept that the people they are dealing with tend to be incredibly intelligent, and tend to network with others, and will tell people to steer clear of certain companies that don't project the right attitudes.


In other words, the evaluation done during an ""interview"" is a TWO WAY street, not one way. Companies that think they are there to interrogate a subject to see if they will sing and dance just so are doing it wrong. The people they think are there to plead their case for a job may have many other irons in the fire.


In a down market, the behavior of toxic companies is even worse. I've seen some truly awful and frankly, stupid, behavior."
Except integrity.  Which Clinton sadly lacks.  But since you think lying is acceptable then Clinton is for you?  You whine and moan about Bush and Cheney lying then turn around and advocate for Clinton.  Sounds hypocritical to me.

Sorry I misread you. However you returned the favor. I said  `(`The US had been interfering with Muslim countries in the Middle East since WW2. Arabs and the US exchanged blows and then 911).`
That is pre Afghanistan.

Trump is a social liberal. He will say anything to get into power. I love that the republicans have to get behind him to save face; they are as stupid as a bag of hammers.

"Jeff Sessions is well known for judging people by the  color of their skin, and judging black Americans as unfit to share public accommodations, including public schools, with white people.

Stretching the truth to satisfy your partisan agenda I think. The liberals were ready to concede on a 5 billion dollar accounts receivable from the US. Harper got in and was able to collect 4 of the 5 billion Martin was going to write off to bad debts. Don' try to rewrite history because you think it will help Justin out here. There is no helping that fool.
"our Pm is such a baboon.....no one respects him, he is useless and incompetent.  why is he prancing around the country as if he is ""hot stuff"" - he is pathetic. I hope those who voted for him see what he is really all about now.  Instead of helping Canadians he is helping his own cuases BUT WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS.  The power has gone to his little big fat head!  Number 1 goof ball ever.  How embarassing for Canada."
"Yet you were mad at Harper and the Conservatives running deficits during on of the worst world recessions which somehow Trudeau deficits during non-recessionary times and projected endless deficits is somehow good, I guess the irony goes right over your head or is that one of the hypocrite talking points provided by Butts?"
"If only Trudeau was as smart and had balls instead of a p***y and got that Toyota plant to stay in Canada . Nope,  instead of that is shipping out billions of dollars to African countries to create clean technology jobs there instead of here. The younger generations of Canada will pay for his  foolishness but it turns out this will be poetic justice since they are mainly responsible for electing him. Good luck with that, oh you millennial fools."
"""Populism is simply code for stupidity and willful ignorance."" Spoken by a guantanamo a supporter of elitism. Elitists like guantanamo are delusional if they believe that they can win over people with insults by calling them ""uninformed and misinformed ... who...  don't have the capacity to understand issues"". If all elitists are as delusional as guantanamo they don't stand a chance against populists."

"Add to the story the fact that it was deemed newsworthy that the Saudi King, ACTUALLY  SHOOK MELANIA TRUMP'S HAND, while she visited his country, and it is not hard to see why the Mainstream Muslim World is just not compatible with Modern Western Society. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Women there, are treated like garbage.  It is not hard to see how that degree of male domination can sow the seed of hatred and radicalization towards anything or anybody who is different."

What would Jesus do?"
"We DONT need DACA recipients to support our SS and welfare!!!! Since 1986 amnesty, the illegal alien population has increased from 3.6 million to 12-20 million!!!! DACAs make piddling little money and they and their parents and anchor rat siblings have BLED OUR COUNTRY DRY TO ITS BONES.

They cost us a MINIMUM OF 200 billion each year......K-12 education at 15 k each school year, ESL classes, overcrowding in schools, free medical (been to an ER lately???), 20k for popping out each illegal anchor rat, in-state tuition, incarceration in prison, judicial expenses for their false claims, use of infrastructure for free and sending BILLIONS in remittances to their country!

 So, multiply 30 years (since 1986) times 200 billion = 6 TRILLION $$$$$!!!!!!!! SIX FREAKING trillion......for liars, cheaters, law breakers and THIEVES,!!!!

I find the sympathy toward this pedophile absolutely astounding.  Anyone who has followed this story knows this was not a one time offense.  These animals who prey on children do not deserve to breathe air.

"Well, that was a lie-fest... Talk about pulling numbers out of your behind (insert eye roll here)... What a stupid article."

Paris sucks (thank the refugees) but the majority of France itself is nice.  I wasn't a huge fan of Germany but I'll say one thing for the Germans ... They don't have as many child molesters as the Americans do.  They might of tortured and killed kids; but you didn't hear many reports of them raping them during WWII.  Americans couldn't even boast that during the civil war and we were fighting ourselves but yeah it's a don't throw stones when you live in a glass house kind of world honey.  I wouldn't talk down about anyone else's country atm.  

It's much simpler and more realistic to say that what works for some won't necessarily work for others in respect to gun control laws.  Especially not our entitled (everyone gets a trophy future leaders).  Americans will never surrender their guns period."
"Sure, Vinis can think or feel that way about Trump, but as the mayor her public display of HATERED for somebody undermines her ""welcoming"" theme just because she happens to disagree.  It makes her appear hypocritical, childish, and unprofessional."
"Whoa... Talk about superficial and divisive! You know nothing about this woman. She didn't even say that she voted for Trump (only that she hoped he would win) and all she said to her friends was that she was ""comfortable"" with ""how the election turned out"". These people have been friends for YEARS, and you're honestly condoning them cutting her out of their lives entirely? And you say Trump is the childish one. I have friends who voted for Hillary, a lying, manipulative woman who left four Americans to be slaughtered. Did I cut them out of my life? Absolutely not. The choices for this election were awful, I think most people agree on that. Both candidates have done and said terrible things. Unless you know someone who actually agrees with the specific horrible things Trump and Hillary have done/said, most of us recognize that everyone was just trying to choose the lesser of the evils."

"This is nonsense. The idiots running the zoo.

First thing, require every day in court to start at 8 am, not 10 am. One half hour lunches (one hour maximum), not two hours for lunch, and finish the day at 5 pm, not 3 pm. This is not an exaggeration. It's time the judges and prosecutors started working for their money. This would double the amount of time available in court, probably resulting in an immediate 70% increase in results, with the same amount of resources.

Second, require judges and prosecutors to sit through the summer like most working people. Three or four weeks holiday maximum. If you don't want to work fulltime, then we'll replace you with people who want to provide a full day's work.

Third, shed the stupid 18th century gowns and ancient technology and procedures. Start using modern technology to its fullest. No need to eliminate fundamental legal tenets.

Simply throwing more money at a broken, lazy system will not fix anything."

Do you think he made a claim about an action that he didn't actually perform?  

See the problem?

If he did what he said he could do ""any time he wanted"" he is a man who treats women like property.

If he didn't, he's a liar who said he did something that he didn't do.

Bill Clinton, at worst, cheated on his wife, something that we're all pretty sure Hillary had at least a smidgen of awareness about. He said that he didn't do something that he did do. 

They are still married. Their first for each.

For the background check are you suggesting if I give my son a gun he must undergo a background? I don't mind gun shows being held to that standard, but I personally will not be. What effect will that have on criminals getting guns?

What level of training must I have before you will permit me to own a gun? Expert? Marksman? 3 day course? Will criminals be allowed training? If not, how will they be stopped from having guns.

People being held accountable for child tragedies, fine, I'm in. But explain how that reduces gun violence.  Sure it punishes some idiot for letting his 3 year old play with a weapon. But do you think time in jail is a larger deterrent that a dead child? 

Nothing you propose seems to effect or target the cause of the problem? it is all aimed at the gun. So tell me how, as long as guns exist, will you stop gun violence? Answer- Take all the guns!"

"This is one of the most pathetic stories published I have ever read. How many college graduates from other generations would call their daddy after getting pushed while drunk? Considering it was on Halloween  weekend the vast majority of students on campus or that come into campus on weekends like that are to party and get drunk. That's just the blunt truth. If you cannot take responsibility for your own actions and know that when you are going out you run the risk of encountering people whom are drunk as well and not fully coherent (especially on a college campus ) than you don't need to be out.

 Not only is this story beyond biased but Mike Holland you sound like a sorry ass  bitch. You would think you would've outgrown running to your little daddy, keep it pushing buddy-- Carrington is a hard working student athlete WITH character above anything else."

No, when the Tridentine Mass was the standard, a significant part of the congregation would pray the rosary, since they had nothing else to do while the Mass was going on. Unlike you, I know this from personal experience.

"You are woefully under-informed. There was weeks of intelligence briefings about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Benghazi. There were briefings at the State Department, some of which Hillary attended that were documented and Ambassador Stevens received many briefings as well leading up to his trip to the consulate. He asked on several occasions for an expanded security force and that was denied. And again, with lots of Al Qaeda activity and the tenuous security situation in Benghazi, well known to State and Stevens, the date was 9/11. How many times have there been at least very hostile demonstrations or attacks? And with the ambassador at the consulate? How stupid was State is the proper question?"
"Another coward with a gun...the very definition of a gang banger. What we really need is easier access to guns for the mentally challenged and mentally ill. Guns are simply too easy for nutcase to obtain and hoard.

I guess that partially explains why USA has over 40,000 murders annually."

Notice all the proud patriot bigots on here don't have a single case to cite in support of their risible arguments. Sexual assault is already illegal and the bathroom law will not prevent one. What it will do is give scumbags justification to ""demand"" proof of gender for anyone who does not immediately conform to their ideals of how people should look. It will make vulnerable, marginalized individuals ashamed and afraid to exercise basic bodily functions. It will give Minnery a great opportunity to demonstrate his primary contribution to our community, which is to siphon dollars from gullible conservatives.

11 out of 13 players on every NBA team are Black. This is a sure sign of discrimination and racism!  The only cure is a type of affirmative action where the owners must only hire White guys until there are at least 7 on each team. (penalized them by one because they must pay for these most egregious past transgressions). Oh, and in keeping with the whole equality thing lately, Lebron must give me half of his money.  You know, so we are EQUAL. We can flip a coin for the Lamborghini."
"What a bunch of hypocrites. All meat eaters no doubt, many hunters as well.  Whining about how this bison got killed before they could get their jollies off killing her and her offspring ""legally."" Pathetic."

"About fifteen years ago they brought one of those traffic experts up here to make suggestions. His big one was to take Northern Lights down to two lanes between New Seward and Minnesota. Had nice pretty drawings made up and everything.

Can you imagine what a mess that road would be if we had been dumb enough to follow through on it?"
"Richard Wright, I see you like your own comments. Troll on, buddy!"
"I am not a Trump hater like some people here, just bash him for the sake of bashing him. I want to give him a little time, observe his action before passing any judgements. So far, all I found is unpredictability and instability. Recently, he handles the North Korean issue badly. The most disappointing is his stance on the Charlottesville incident. Be it liberals or conservatives, we have to draw a line somewhere; this country has no place for Nazism, White Supremacy and racism. We just have to stand up against such bigotries. His 'two sides' talk is absolutely ridiculous. There are no two sides; Nazism and racism is outright wrong!"
"Any system where a ""caregiver"" is paid $8K/month while absent and irresponsible ... might that set up some red flags, somewhere ???!!! 

A second matter - I am not familiar with the foster care system - but it is my understanding that foster parents do not retain their children for more than a year - some silly rule somewhere. Anybody clarify this ? If that is so it is another idiotic piece of bureaucracy .....

Anyway - this case is an embarrasment to our so called caring Canadian culture."

"Here is an idea.

Don't want a baby?

Don't get pregnant.

It is completely within the power of the female human to make that initial choice, and once said choice is made, either for or against conception, they own said choice.

We men are pigs, to be sure, though not as many as one may think, but it is the female that ultimately decides whether she shall be impregnated or not.

Women are indeed within control of not only their bodies, but their biological ability to give birth, and if they do not want to become a mother, than they should take whatever steps they need to so as to prevent said action.

THAT is the female power.

THEY decide whether they shall bear a child or not.

Abortion is for those that do not own their personal decisions, or are simply too obtuse, or lazy, to own said decisions.

And do not even get me started about Planned Parenthood and its eugenics based beginning."
"agree with your co-workers because everyone needs to have the same views on everything....being an individual is now out!  Male and female alike all must shave their heads and faces, no makeup allowed, no eyeglasses, must use contact lenses.  Conform to the liberal crap everyone, so none of them are offended by anyone actually  having a BRAIN!"
"This case is clearly of the highest level of stupidity of political correctness. 
The Supreme Court of Canada is not God!!! Their ruling could be wrong.
He was terrorist not POW, even if US not using Geneva convention was wrong, that does not mean he was innocent, different issues! Yes, Canada somehow didn't do it right. But Canada letting him home and setting him free now is already the decent compensation. In my opinion, he should serve a life term for the treason.
This 10.5-millim stinks and was wrong.

Many things in this story don't add up. Stealing the Magic Bus and driving it down the Seward Highway? I can't imagine someone would think they'd get away with it. The article also said that the owner had it re-keyed so unless it was broken into someone obviously had the combo and I seriously doubt all 12 passengers would knowingly jump on a stolen bus for a joyride to Seward unless this is a case of the 13 most dumbest criminals of all time.

How about producing plays where the President is assassinated and the left goes wild?
How about a Democrat going to a baseball field to massacre Republicans and the Democrats...especially the scum Obama...show little outrage?
And then we have Democrat women dressing up in the ""C"" caps and vagina suits prancing around and calling out for his assassination.
MALIGNANT?  YOU are an IDIOT!"

"David Duke himself voted for trump, along with all the KKK, American NAZI Party, and most white Southerners. Trump is the only presidential candidate endorsed by the KKK who did NOT turn down the endorsement.

The Congressional Republican Caucus is open ONLY to Republicans, therefore open to only three three black Congressmen. The other 45 black Congress men and women aren't alowed entry. Those are FACTS, not your racist Rush Limbaugh/Sean Hannity crazy babbling and lies. Your entire political perspective rests on bigotry and lies. Now your head is about to explode, and you'll start talking nonsense in sub-civil language. It's back on mute for you, little snowflake. Or is that, just, flake?

Uh-Oh, too late! Incoming! But I voted it ""not civil"", and it's so nasty, in a schoolyard taunt sort of way, that it likely will never be published."
"Small hands, small brain, small -----. Trump is like the limbo song."
Trump is the most petty and vindictive president in my lifetime. Repulsive.
"There is not a more unlikeable, tone deaf imbecile in the HOC than Stephane Dion. His ignorance is profound."
"I'll acknowledge -- I'm about the most progressive guy you can imagine.  The only thing I agreed with Donald Trump on was keeping the U.S. away from the craziness in the Middle East.  But now that he's found an issue that gives him some kind of political brownie points, he's probably gonna go all crazy on the Middle East too!"
No-one in modern times has gone farther to make ignorance acceptable than Donny Trump and his flunkies.
"It doesn't matter if it is State or City and County Controlled , the level of incompetence never ceases to amaze me.  I guess this is what happens when you have a bunch of Self Centered, Lying, Deceitful, Corrupt Donkeys (A#$%S) in office.  What is  happening to this beautiful State along with its hard working taxpayers are appalling.  It is time for a Federal Investigation into the corruption of this one party Government."
"Quite a pathetic deflection, I guess I should go back to when the Irish came to North America and the women actually pulled the plow because they couldnt afford a horse or ox to pull it.

Leaving out the fact that the comments she made would get any white anchor or someone speaking about like that about Obama sent to a gulag."
I think he's both....he's definitely ignorant.
The Clintons are going to jail! What a wonder fun day. They are the swamp.
"I wouldn't call White House press secretary a dream job, I'd call it a nightmare.  These folks seem to have very little day-to-day contact with the President, yet are expected to answer detailed questions from the press on every aspect of the President's recent activities and direction.  Spicer's actions were no different from what we saw from Jody Powell, George Stephanopoulos, or Jay Carney.  We see these people twisting facts, telling half the story, and getting recent policy direction wrong, but basically all they are doing is pretending they know something when they really don't.  Spicer was particularly ill suited for the job, as he was short-tempered and could not control the room, thus it is better if Trump chooses someone with a more suitable temperament for this job, i.e., someone who doesn't mind looking foolish on a daily basis."
I don't think that the point is that violence is wrong.  Who would not agree with that?  Giving credence to white supremes by allowing their vile hatred to go unchallenged or by mixing apples and oranges is simply not right.  These groups seek to undermine American values and do so openly and when they are given an out by the president by implicating those pushing back is wrong.  These white neo-nazis are full of hatred and must be challenged.  The white supremes perpetrate violence and keep in mind that words can be violent.  The statues have become symbols of these angry misguided people.
"Carl , you and other Liberals have the nerve to lecture the conduct of President Trump, when the Left with their conduct of Hate, Disrespect, Vicious Rhetoric , continually attacking the President, Mis Characterizing his every move. It doesn't take much experience to notice, the vindictiveness, the hatred, right from the beginning, outrage that Trump won, that the Democrats lost.  
WHAT IS EXPECTED OF SOMEONE WHO GETS ATTACKED, RIDICULED , INSULTED? DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO  GET SLAPPED, AND THEN TURN HIS OTHER CHEEK ,ASKING FOR MORE?
WHAT LEADER, OF A NATION WITH SUCH PROBLEMS ,TO HAVE AN APOLOGETIC WIMP AS PRESIDENT..
THIS EVIL DELUSION , PUT INTO ACTION, MIXED WITH HATE , IS AND WILL DEVELOP INTO A CIVIL WAR, A DIVIDED NATION.
This will not bode well with God !!!"
"Tragic and pathetic, and some pathetic comments by brexit supporters here. The European Union has made it possible for Western Europe to remain at peace for 70 years, probably longer than at any time in history.
The pathetic aspect of this is that the British folks who have legitimate grievances have been brainwashed to blame foreigners for troubles for which their own governments are entirely responsible, as well as the class system of British society. They have kept in power for decades the very elements of British society who have no interest whatsoever in improving the conditions of the working classes and ordinary folks. Unfortunately the past few months have made it clear that the present Tory government has no clue how to deal with this situation."

"Actually, Trump tossed the issue back to the states where it belongs.

Might want to be careful with what you define as sexuality.  Sex is set at the cellular level nearly at the moment of conception.  No amount of wishful thinking or medical mutilation of various body parts or child abuse masquerading as tolerance of some bizarre notion of 'choice' is going to change it.  

What if you or I suddenly decide we want to identify as a turnip?  Does that choice, that decision, actually make us a turnip?  hardly.  It does, OTOH, make us at some level mentally ill which is another thing entirely.  Cheers -"
Bennet is a do nothing Senator along with Cory Gardner. It is their job to fund federal transportation infrastructure. And they are stupid for suggesting another toll road. The bureaucracy is not incompetent. It is the politicians who are incompetent. They want to raise taxes on the middle class.

"Allow me to do your homework for you. The federalists tried to give Patrick Henry a congressional seat to help draft the US Constitution. Henry turned down this power stating; ""I SMELL A RAT!"" When he federalists produced a constitution that omitted a bill of rights we saw the rats Henry smelled.  As an antifederalist Henry bitterly opposed the federalists power grab.  ""Fellow Virginians, no tyrant can touch you now. I have made sure of that. You have a bill of rights that protects you. You arm yourselves against the weak and defenseless (state government) yet expose yourself naked to the armed and powerful (fed government).
 It was Henry who drafted 40 amendments in the form of a federal Bill of Rights, and in the end he won us 25 of the 40. Five alone are found in the 1st amendment. Henry was very clear on the intent of the 2nd amendment he warned us to guard as if our lives depend on it, for if the tyrants get this one they get them all."

"Owners permitted this racist cancer to spread when they didn't treat it in its infancy. They were afraid that addressing it would cause a backlash from some ghetto players whose attitudes they already knew. What they failed to realize was that the public and the NFL rode out a player's strike many years ago and the sport came back stronger. Real Americans would have done the same again. Fire the Antifa thugs that have infiltrated America's favorite sport. The result will be that the fan base will come back even stronger when the NFL proves that football loves America as much as America loves football. Let the illiterates, ingrates, and thugs that put race over country find other jobs they are better qualified to do; prison guard comes immediately to mind. That way they can associate with the rest of their hateful, delusional, classless ilk."
"Why is everything you Repubs don't like just silly.

As is the persistent posting of the same ridiculous comment.
So the Alaskan people can't get services they need but the oil companies get paid.   That's pretty sound logic (sarcasm). Maybe if Meyer and Chinault included the Democrats in the decision making process all along they would be done by now.   Seems to me this happened a year ago and the republicans didn't learn anything from that (except that they get to continue receiving a per deim check for each day they stay in session.  And BTW I've been a registered republican since I was able to vote.  But I call it like I see it and these so called republican leaders are idiots.

"Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Target ‘Jew Haters’.png


Today, ProPublica published a bombshell report showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to target certain users. Facebook apparently has ad categories such as:

*Jew Hater
*How to burn Jews
*History of why Jews ruin the world

Really. 


Well, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you!

At the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis."
If his memory was cloudy he shouldn't have said anything. Soaring like an eagle one day and grounded like a penguin the next.

"So you are now going to be willing to call out old soul and icon et al? Two folks among others here who have called for violence against all who have a different view from them? How about all who have called me and others racist when ever we opposed any of the lefts views? How about left wing politicians wishing for the presidents assassination? Do you believe celebrities who voice ill will towards our president should be held accountable for their despicable words? The aclu has fought successfully for even despicable groups like the neo-nazis, white supremacist blm and others to voice hate towards others. Both the right and the left citizens in this Nation have followed the leaders of the parties and use hate speech and fear towards opposing views. We as a people need to quit being used. Everyone has the right to free speech, no matter how hate filled and ignorant. I do not attend rally's or protest I disagree with. I support the Constitution."

And where is the logic in taxing only foreign speculators/  There's more domestic speculators than ever before?  Tax anyone trading in real estate for anything other than principal residence. Problem solved.

The Liberals ruined the electricity market.  Hello disaster for the residential real estate market. 

Oh how I wish the entire gang of them would simply evaporate."
"So anybody who opposes Trump is ""the Left""? What arrogance and bovine excrement! And you can speak of ""sweeping generalizations"" with a straight face while accusing ""the Left"" of ""breathtaking hypocrisy""? Do you know yourself at all?"
Of course so why is the Chump and his administration walking the same trail?  That is what's so baffling. An American military hero who lost his son in war being duped by Bozo the Clown 🤡!

You are clueless if you really believe in this protest. When I turn on football I want to watch football. These players are not oppressed and the BLM movement is predicated on a lie.

So much so that the spineless politicians caved to public pressure and passed a FOREIGN buyer taxes to curtail their investment activity with mixed results of course because politicians are not foolish enough to kill the golden goose that fuels the BC economy.

But racist pigs like yourself endlessly repeat the same hate filled rants against one specific ethnicity, the Chinese. There is no denying their participation in the market, by the media, politicians or industry participants, yet you continue to single them out and brand them as a threat to the Canadian way of life.

You are disgusting and should be banned permanently for spewing endless hatred on a public forum."

"Genius, people who buy cocaine and heroin by the ton have no trouble having their supplier throw a few cases of guns in the shipment.   You can buy a fully-automatic AK platform weapon in the ME, Africa, and much of South Asia and South America for a hundred bucks or less.  Brand name handguns are hard to get, but there are lots of serviceable copies out there.   There is relatively little flow of legally purchased weapons to criminals.   Most guns in the hands of criminals were illegally purchased by straw men, stolen, or smuggled.   Of course, not a few were put in the hands of criminals by the Obama Administration in their unbelievably stupid ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running operation.   No legitimate bad guy would be caught dead with a US legal semi-automatic weapon.

"Okay, Trumpian nitwits, time to settle down and recognize a ""dog whistle"" when you hear it.  Everyone agrees that the welfare system needs to be continually improved and monitored, and laws need to be enforced.  BUT TRUMP IS NOT DOING THIS TO SAVE MONEY, and you know it.  It's done to get overweight, racist, white people (see photo) riled up with hate.  You seem to fall for the message quite easily.   The small number of immigrants or homeless people collecting benefits, pales in comparison to the money spent on defense or on welfare and social benefits going to US citizens.  Please use your brain (hard for you trumpians) to see how many Trump, red-state, white people have been on the public dole for years.  Also, your Fox-news, GOP facts about getting wealthy on welfare are ridiculous, as are you and the people who believe them.  Please keep posting, I love reading nonsense by trump-sycophants.  Thank you."

It's time for a mental eval because Trump dare point out your violent Marxist friends are damnable scum?
"They are stupid. They were manipulated with lies and with hatred. That's undeniable.  Trump branded his supporters like pimps do with harlots, turning them into mindless bots who lack the intelligence to disagree with anything he says or does. The latest rant is a small example of his vile character. Others were worse, including mocking a handicapped reporter.  
Like Einstein said, two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And he wasn't sure about the universe.

A huge red flag comes up when you mention "" no matter their disability rating "" . A vet who has occasional headaches shouldn't get the same amount as a person in a wheelchair .  It sounds like you and Reid want those with next to no problems to get more than they deserve.  Reid hasn't fixed the vet problem in all his years in D.C.   This lame duck shouldn't be trusted now."
"Did you GRAB his hand from his side ? Because that would, indeed, be assault (or possibly battery - the differences are subtle and only really important to lawyers). But if you held out your hand, and he reached out to shake it, then he DID consent to that contact.

Consent doesn't have to be verbal. If you claim non-verbal consent, the court will judge on testimony whether it was reasonable to interpret the actions of the person as consent. If he pulled his hand back, and you grabbed toward it-  you'd be guilty. If he shook yours - you're fine.

Much as - if you grab a woman and kiss her, that's usually sexual assault. If you stop a few centimeters away, and wait to see if you she comes in and kisses you back - then it is consensual. You tried to commit a reductio et absurdium fallacy, but all you managed to do is be silly. If you intended to show that the law is silly, then you failed, because it's not as your silly example is entirely legal."

At 73 years of age, I still have a brain that works just fine and also a very long memory.  Just before calling me laughable for not ignoring history, you claim that credible, quoted sources are ""old wives tales"" and, in a less than brilliant diversion, focus on Trump's tax returns.  There is no law that says a POTUS has to reveal his tax returns.  It may be a tradition--or past-presidents may have been bullied into revealing their taxes--but there is no obligation for Trump to reveal anything about his taxes.  If he has done something illegal or hasn't paid them or paid enough, the Dems in the IRS would be on him in a nanosecond.  BTW, I'm thrilled to learn that Hillary is not POTUS.

What people fail to understand is that Canadians don't live in a bubble, and in fact everything we do affects everyone else. The writer of this Crappy misinformation clickbait bullshit opinion piece makes it seem like it's just rich Vancouver liberals who don't want to look at tankers, so their willing to sacrifice all of the rest of Canada so they can maintain the value of their real estate properties. Further investing in the oil and gas industry when we should be phasing it out actually affects everyone on the planet forever. 

Meanwhile over production and lower costs of oil globally is what has put Canadians out of work, not lack of oil infrastructure. Production stopped because oil became less profitable. Demand has been decreasing and global exports keep increasing. Why are we propping up a failing industry for a few people who refuse to retrain and re-enter the work force?"

To put Trump on their level is laughable. Anything Trump can't steal, eat, bully or  f*** is either worthless or a threat in his eyes.

why don't you follow your own pathetic advice?
"Clearly   some  of  the  self  loathers  on here  don't  like  white  people  like  Trump.  PR  is  basically a  parasite,  receiving  billions  and  giving  us  nothing  in  return. 
You  know  how  they  reward  our  largess  and  support?  By  buying  90%  of  their  automobiles  from  Asia.
Give  them  independence  now."

"Well, that comment sucked."
Maybe. Trump was right.   Idiots on both sides.

"Well skeexix, you couldn't be more wrong.  Whereas he did start out with millions (not 100) and ended up with Billions which is thousands of millions of  dollars. He made his daddy money look like chump change and earned a reputation for being one of the greatest builders of our time.   Now, on the RR comparison. Didn't RR win the governorship of some little state like, what was it?California?  Oh, yeah.  And a couple of times at that.  Then he ran for president as the anointed one, and sure enough.....  The first time Trump EVER ran for ANY political race, it was a race He Couldn't Win, a race where He Had NO Path, a race where in  reality he scorched the competition. You know, in the Electoral College, the one the election depends on? Well , Hillary didn't consider that, now did she? But all the  poor followers drank the Kool-Aid and supplicated to the Chosen One.  Who LOST, and just can't, darn it, just won't LET IT GO!"
"Bob Karman.  How can you use ""tolerant"" and ""progressive"" in the same sentence?  Hawaii may indeed be tolerant--about race, skin color, cultural practices, and even religion--but it is far from tolerant when it comes to differences in ideology.   Just look at Hawaii's electoral history.  Any Republican who dares run against the Democrat Monarchy is vilified, trashed, slandered, and otherwise destroyed in the public forum.  Progressives play nice only when you agree with them; their hypocritical double-standards and misunderstanding of the constitutional role of government in our lives are pathetic.

"Telling people to 'suck it up' isn't the right approach in the case of clinical depression.  I think the concern is that the accommodations being made are for minor ailments.  For someone with a depressive episode a 'time out' for a term or two, or redo-ing a term are surely better options than to nudge the problem along with puppies on campus."
"""Rude"" to a union goon or a lefty is saying anything you don't like.

"Always pleasure GREENLEAF, just google ""Plate Climatology Theory"", it has only come to the fore-front of research in the last decade or so, there are many articles on it. It's in it's infancy, but as it points out, data on this underwater activity with vents and huge volcanoes that truly dwarf those on land, especially the plate faults and their ever releasing not just CO2, but methane and other gases that effect the environment, has been scarce. As you point out, many through history believed their impact to be negligible, but that opinion is being researched, new data gathered and challenged. 


Our government is very much part of the polarized political debate on climate change, sadly, when opposition presents, it is dismissed often out of hand. We assumed the underwater volcanoes and vents acted a particular way as to be of no concern, they don't throw into the atmosphere thus they don't bring cooling.

"Imbecilic rantings and ravings of Raul Grijalva of Arizona (a staunch Sanders-Socialist supporter) cares NOT for the citizens of this state, but rather for maintaining his position within State Government.  
A few of his gems of brilliancy:  
Determined the border-wall would prohibit the migration of birds ...yes, birds ...who FLY over walls; 
Proclaimed a boycott AGAINST Tucson AZ (his beloved city), during the state's SB 1070 immigration bill, with the following details:  ""We're asking organizations, civic, religious, labor, Latino, organizations of color to refrain from using Arizona as a convention site, to refrain from spending their dollars in the state of Arizona..."" - further elaborating to keep-out Superbowls, concerts and all events beneficial to Tucson;
Rounding out his stupidity - called for the boycott of ""Arizona Ice Tea"" - which BTW is based in NewYork - NOT Arizona - in protest to immigration policies.
Simplified:  Grijalva is a lunatic in a powerful local govt seat."
The term 'transgender' is a sick joke. It is a mental disorder that should be treated as such. When you have children that claim to have this transgender illness there is no doubt it something that needs to be addressed before they make the mistakes so many have with becoming an adult.
"Here's a bit of reality, the right to religious liberty, like many other rights is not absolute. This is especially true when you're using religion as a pretext to discriminate others. There's no other two ways about it. If your religion insists on discriminating other human beings, don't be a hypocrite and expect the law to condone it!"

"The city has tried to and has already worked with these owners in the past but they do not keep up their end of the deal. This is not a case of stupid government, smart commentator. 
They continue to use this property as a bargaining chip to attempt to get tax breaks for other projects like tearing down the 4th Avenue Theater just as they already have with 188 Northern Lights. The city has already agreed to waive all fees for material disposal if they tear down the building."
The truth is no Canadians know Canadian values because there are not any outside of tired cliches and corrupt politicians babbling self-interest nonsense!
"Maybe these wankers wrote the fake intelligence report.

"Carrying a weapon is the quickest way to get shot by a cop, especially if you're male and black. Your best bet is to simply be polite and refuse to cooperate if you're convinced you're in the right.

"You are demanding facts from me?😀😀 Again, as usual, you don't read and/or understand what you respond to. 

Where exactly were the millions of Muslims marching worldwide? Where were the diplomatic notes and protests, the demands for apology, the fatwahs, the demands for punishing those who insulted Islam? Where were all these when Muslim people in the name of Islam commit these hatefilled crimes? If Islam is as much a religion of peace as it is claimed, then such heinous acts  should be considered as the greatest insult to Islam. So, where is the worldwide outrage?

You say there were protests.... Where? When? Some FACTS pleas! 😀😀

And, no, I am not interested in the one or two comments ... I am interested in the millions of people's reactions, standing up to protect the honour of their religion, just as they did after the cartoons were published. 

Oh... they did just mainstream US media did not report on it? Well, point me to ANY media, then!"
I live in Denver.  People like you are a big part of the problem.
"Exactly...such poor reporting. Pathetic really, no wonder everyone in Eugene and Springfield get their news on line.  Way to go Jack."
"""The U.S. is among these 7 countries [out of 198] that permit elective abortion past 20 weeks.… These countries/territories are: Canada (no restriction in law), China (no restriction in law), Netherlands (24 weeks), North Korea (no restriction in law), Singapore (24 weeks), United States (viability), Vietnam (no restriction in law).""

Nice company we're keeping there.  Only Canada, Communist China, Communist North Vietnam, and Communist Vietnam have abortion policies as liberal as ours.  Netherlands and Singapore don't allow them in the third trimester, so we're among only five in the world that do.

http://dailysignal.com/2014/03/12/report-u-s-one-seven-countries-allows-late-term-abortion/

A premature birth at 5 months has a fairly high chance of survival, and has rights at birth.  Why doesn't a full term baby not quite born yet have those same rights?  Are our rights determined by which side of the vagina we're on?  Do men lose them during intercourse?"

Guys like me know Dr's personally or can afford to go to the US for treatment, for the rest of the voting public, they get screwed.

"I generally agree with the article but want to point out that Christians are being persecuted by Muslims in some (most/all?) Moslem majority countries.

Turkey is an example. Last year the Turkish government wanted to ban Christmas (whether it actually did, I can't remember, but it was on the agenda). The highlight of the Christian faith is banned!

Can you imagine if it was even on the agenda that Canada would ban Ramadan?"

"Goodell better step in and take control , he will soon be out on his butt!"
"Dave, we have to be careful about equivalents. Start with the fact that the white supremacists and Nazis want to purge America of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants. That in and of itself is the antithesis of what America is. They are hateful, racist and anti-semitic. Black Lives Matter wants to call attention to (in addition to many other things) the systemic aspects of our justice system that result in the deaths and incarceration of black people at a much higher rate than other populations. They not only do not advocate violence, they advocate justice, peace and love in engagements with others. Now, the reality with both groups may be that there are people who claim affiliation who act with violence (or others claim that the violent are affiliated with the organization.) But that does not make the groups equivalent. They are not. And to believe they are is to admit to some sympathy with the white supremacists. There is no other possible conclusion."
"hey ignorant one,, business owners will gladly pay the highest wages thier industy can afford to reduce turnover (see they unlike you understand those costs) but have to pay wage limits to ensure they make a profit, thats what they are in business for in the first place, THIER livelyhoods, not employees,, funny your heart doesnt bleed for the thousands of min wage people that will lose thier jobs over this"

"Trump said he would kill terrorists children
A terrorist targets children.
Trump said the press is the enemy.
A Republican politician attacks a reporter.
Trump said Muslims are the enemy.

Trump is like a hot Santa Ana wind storm full of blinding dust looking for a flame."
Donald Trump is a hopeless racist who ran a campaign based on racism.  People who voted for him are either racists or guilty of indifference to it.
But point out all of the obvious and completely confirmed crimes Hillary has committed and all of a sudden the only thing that matters and is used by the left to prove her innocence is (as they say) the fact that she hasn't ever been convicted. Go marinate in your own hypocrisy while we laugh about you here.

Original post: I love how Trump makes Liberal heads explode!
It is sad to see anyone lose it like this.  I wonder what the causal factors were.  Of course many don't care and are content to say he is pond scum and deserves whatever he gets.
If my wife tells me there's a man in the female bathroom I will go in and beat him down.  Anyone who knows me knows this to be true... think about it before you enter the ladies restrooms in Anchorage.  Test me! I could care less what the current law says.

One (such as  me) can only comment on what's out there at the moment.  Correct?  Whenever I chose to comment, I do so after researching various news sources (sorry, never FOX/CNN) and digesting those and commenting.  Now.  What I mean by 'news sources' is not sitting in front of the boob tube and listening to idiots TELL ME what their OPINIONS are or what the 3 (that's THREE) billionaires who own ALL of mainstream media want them to think, feel and say.   

I watch C-span when I can.  I use the Intercept.  Propublica.  The Hill.  Democracy Now to name a few.

Everyone knows that these things are not in the lower 48.   I have now changed my mind and want to homestead in VA so I can just crap wherever I feel like, with the pigs, and have some dude with a cowboy hat wearing a dress shirt tell me how and where to crap in an outhouse I really don't need (being a stupid city slicker...arf arf)."

We used to have a timber industry here. The Tongass can easily support a saw log industry: I'm environmentally inclined but preservationism has ruined our home. Our southeast towns are now run by a group I call environmental communists (enviro-comms). These idiots work for the government: they are the only people left with any money! They seek to determine public policy, even tho they could never live here because they are too stupid to be able to survive here without government paychecks.

Good lord who voted for this giant clown . Trudeau can go jump off a bridge.
"Nope.  Just genuine laughter at inane, outrageous and unbelievable stupidity and contradictions.  They were very worthy of laughter.  And Hillary! too!  and I am now having fun with you because you are completely ridiculost and don't know when to stop, so it is easy. I do, however, know when to stop and now is that time.

"So guns, which are the main way people commit murder and suicide (not to mention Dick Cheney style accidents) save more lives than they take. That's what you're saying?

Obviously pot on it's own can't kill you like heroin or meth. Whereas a gun is designed to kill. You could reasonably say based on this article if you saw a gun shop opening up ""Boy another gun store some poor kid is going to end up shot"" and it would be true. Whereas a pot store somehow means more gangs, teen pregnancy, and economic disparity? What?

Right. I'm really seeing how I'm sounding silly and ridiculous.

Again in case you're forgetting I'm not arguing for pot and against guns. I don't understand why you think something as relatively harmless as cannabis should be banned but by the same logic something like guns are well worth the cost.

You've failed to offer an argument. You can keep hurling insults my way and going on about your trash folder but you'd still fail to explain this contradiction to me."
Ridiculous.  The next thing you know other religions in Quebec will want their own cemeteries like  Jewish and Roman Catholic faiths... oh wait.
Trump is more capable of being president than Trudeau is of being PM. Trump is buttering Justin up and the little boy laps it up like ice cream.  i would be sceptical when Trump tells an idiot what a great job he is doing.
Trudeau is a buffoon as was his father . His wife isn't fairing too well either. And they are breeding.

That's the price the sisters will pay for allowing the Koch Brothers and Carl Anderson to use them in that ridiculous birth control lawsuit  -- all the GOP wanted was to kill Medical Care for the poor and elderly, as well as embarrass the black president -- so much of this has been racial.

"The State AG's office is about to get embarrassed.  

Not sure whether or not Judge Watson will shoot them down, but the new EO does all the things that were needed to be done both constitutionally and statutorily in order to remedy the defects of the first EO.

There is just no question that the President -- whether his name is Trump, Obama, Nixon, Lincoln, Jackson, Madison, Jefferson, or Washington -- has the authority to regulate the entry of aliens into the country.  The first EO simply didn't deal with the details properly.  This one does, and the Hawaii AG is going to end up looking like an idiot when it is all done."
Now this is funny!  Of course Hillary never lied. She landed under snipe fire in Bosnia right? Never deleted those emails that were classified? I am glad Trump won! Hillary was the most corrupt person to ever run for the office. Drain the swamp! Hillary went down the drain on Nov 8th and on the 20th so will Obama.

"What an asinine comment, but typical of the left.  Their policies offer so little attraction on their own, they have resorted to slandering all other political outlooks and trying to link them to anything bad in the world, to make theirs appear better by comparison.  It is for that reason that Quine can so righteously pronounce, without a shred of evidence, that the Quebec killers were disciples of Trump.

We've been treated to the same slandering during Stephen Harper's mandate; we're supposed to equate any person who believes in a fiscally conservative and prosperity supporting government with knuckle-dragging neanderthals who are misogynistic, xenophobic, environment killing racists.  The facts speak otherwise."
Exactly!  You can't expect to integrate a LARGE amount of migrants whose culture is to rape women and little boys because they think it's within their right.
I love the fact that these morons describe themselves as experienced hikers. Experienced in hiking the flat rugged terrain of Atlanta? By no means do I consider myself an experienced hiker or an expert outdoorsmen however it never fails that every year I show up some self proclaimed expert from the 48 that thinks venturing into the wilderness of Alaska is an easy task.
"this issue goes far beyond the puff piece of this article and one the RG has published my op-ed letters on for over 25 years. As for your deluded strawman charge, that is a shameless lie, I do not call everyone who does good in our community a liberal. If these clowns cared of the plight of poverty, homelessness, they would be screaming bloody murder our government is taxing people out of housing and onto the streets. Their silence is deafening. Furthermore, until liberals outlawed affordable housing we could build these ""tiny houses"" and support ourselves in independence and dignity. They are not demanding high density planning be repealed, which caused this poverty, affordable housing crisis, they are shamelessly exploiting the poor instead. I came to Eugene living on the streets destitute. I know exactly what it takes to overcome this poverty. I know exactly how this enables this poverty, and shamelessly exploits the poor politically."

Mike AA brought Bill Clinton into the equation by saying that he was a paragon of virtue compared to Trump.
Bill Clinton was a notorious womaniser among other things yet none of you liberals at the time berated or disparaged him on account of his lack of sexual mores because you supported the political aims of the Democratic Party. 
Donald Trump's alleged sexual behaviour has you all  hypocritically responding in high dudgeon, outraged that such a person should become president of the USA., because you do not support the Republican Party.

Their combined resume goes far beyond merely disturbing, it's a deplorable resume of their endless thirst for power and money is driven by their greed even to the point of needless inexcusable human suffering.

With propaganda media there are people who are low and no information Clinton supporters, I get that.. What is crazy are those who know the Clintons nefarious resume and still support them. I can't help but wonder if such support must be from individuals with questionable resumes themselves.

"Charles makes a point, although it leans a bit more to the extreme about the sport killing of ISIS Muslims throwing gays off the roof. Why hold one religion to a different set of standards than another? The Muslim bakers did indeed discriminate and if you look all around everyone discriminates in some way, you discriminate everyday in some form of mannerism with the choices that you make even though you may not realize it. Sometimes you just got to let things slide by instead of trying to control and judge everything that comes up because you can't fight every injustice that occurs. So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said ""Hey, can you do this for us?"" and the dude replied ""No."""

If Putin didn't successfully engineer Trump's victory then it is not from his lack of trying or from wanting that to be the outcome.

The point is that he tried to engineer Trump's victory.

And the overarching question is why.

Why would a corrupt dictator in control of the world's second largest nuclear arsenal and a badly faltering economy want Donald Trump to achieve the Presidency over Hilary Clinton?

His rational is what the historians will be most compelled by.

Trump admires most the brutal tyrants of the world - Putin, Duterte, Kim, Sisi, Saddam.

Trump is a weak, egocentric, anti-intellectual, grifter who is standing helpless on the bridge of the ship as it slowly founders, unable to make the course corrections needed to keep it moving forward.

You may not like it, your op-ed piece in the Globe not withstanding, but that is the very unfortunate reality that the western democracies find themselves in.

"As most will know, the Canadian government has made huge investments in Bombardier, Inc. The success or failure of Bombardier as a going financial concern is currently dependent on its aircraft division, which is building a new commercial jet. Bombardier's long-time competitor in this sector is a Brazilian company, Embraer.

We know that the Canadian government made a network attack against the Brazilian Ministry of Mines a few years ago. Obviously the information being sought was of an economic nature. Today, with so much at stake, it's foolish to assume that GovCan wouldn't mount a network attack on a private Brazilian firm, also looking for economically useful information. After all, if you'll hack the Brazilian government, why would you refuse to touch a Brazilian company?

The same is generally true of all nations with hacking capabilities. Absent some treaty, they will attempt to penetrate the networks of both foreign governments and foreign companies."

The US even hacked into Angela Merkel's phone.  

Yet John McCain considers it an act of war if Russia hacked into private (Clinton and Podesta) US emails. The US then has waged unprovoked war on 40 countries since WW2, by his own estimation. 

Talk about the teapot calling the kettle black!

The Rocks should be looking to move Bridich's other expensive mistake, Ian Desmond. Ironically the Rockies could probably re-sign Cargo, the guy they expected to replace with Desmond, for far less than Desmond is costing them.

"The USA should step back from its position of policeman & welfare insurer of the world.
In Syria, the rebel factions are shot thru with isis & other muslim extremists. Primarily it's a case of muslims murdering other malevolent muslims. Of course there are exceptions, but we should be guided by the overall picture, not the mini vignettes.
We should have learned long ago, that intervening & hoping to impose US morality & democratic systems on other vastly different cultures does not work. But these efforts do take American lives & treasure, which should be better spent right here at home.
Intervening in violence-torn Guatemala, Somalia, Sudan, etc. are similarly inappropriate for the USA.
Each country must, & will eventually, work out their own problems - be they economic, lawlessness, etc."
"This is unbelievable. If the man hadn't resisted, it wouldn't have been a problem. The police stayed remarkably calm.  Of COURSE the police felt threatened and like the situation could turn dangerous. The majority of the people in that crowd/mob had no idea what was going on.  It was simply angry, easily incited people who are biased against the police and have no ability to think rationally. If I had seen this incident? I would have been frightened - not because of the police, but because of the ridiculous mob.  Anyone can cry out ""police brutality"" - and this? Was not it. They did not injure the man they were trying to arrest until he had been resisting for minutes, and they needed to quickly diffuse an escalating situation. What a completely unnecessary incident caused by angry, belligerent, crass, foolish individuals. I can't believe this happened in Eugene."

The wives comment was over the top, for sure, though. 

Used to coach youth basketball for the Y.  One of the coaches I worked with was an absolute jerk to the kids.  The kids weren't having fun and did terrible.  Next coach was a true coach for kids, and the team did great.  We even got to play during half time of a Nuggets game.  The kids were so funny running out on to the court...most of them just looking around amazed at what they were seeing.  I think there was one score in about 3 minutes of play.  Classic!"

"""We are as rife as anyone else in intolerance, bigotry and ignorance.""

  Precisely, Professor.
  It's typical Canadian hypocrisy that the spate of books on Canada's ""postnational"" multiculturalism in 1999 arrived when more Canadians than ever were applying for an American green card, more folks than ever were slamming our health care system, more were demanding Americanized privatization of everything, and Canada came closer than ever to becoming the 51st state of the USA.

Furthermore, today Canada has all the same problems as our neighbour to the south, only in smaller quantities.
  Canada isn't above and beyond bigotry, poverty, racism ,violence and war. Canada isn't the United Nations. The United Nations is the United Nations.
  The arrogance and hypocrisy of Canadians are much like those of Americans - but in smaller quantities that often pass under the political radar.
   As a branch plant of the corporate empire we're doing quite well. But there's much room for improvements."
"Harper was not a fan of terrorists, that's for sure.  There would not have been a $10.5 million payment to our Canadian terrorist under his watch.

In contrast, his successor pays our terrorist millions, makes a mockery of protecting our borders, issues apologies like an obsessive-compulsive, spends like a drunken sailor, and subjects us to never-ending selfies.  Now THAT's torture."
"There is no chance of ""numerous"" murderers, pedophiles and child abusers being released. ""A few"" certainly. 

Incidentally, there is no law against being a pedophile if you are not a child abuser. It is only acting on pedophilic urges that is a crime."

Sadly ironic that the white supremacists wore MAGA hats and the idiot who drove that Challenger into the crowd was a nazi sympathizer.  Yep....these are the morons who helped elect Trump."

"Politifact gave Trump the highest rate of lies during the presidential campaign that I have ever heard of...as I recall 70% lies and the next 15% are half and half....I just round it out to 80%.....

Hillary along with the average other candidate some where in the 20-30% range which isint all that wonderful but a heck a lot better than Trump. 

I see no reason to have confidence in a President as a ""truth teller"" when his campaign was so full of lies.

The single most shocking thing to me was that folks actually believed his lies OR simply didn't care about the lies or the misogyny or the racism,or sexism or whatever....

I personally find that fact to be even scarier than Trump....."

"really, this old fool has never said one nice thing about a republican that I can remember"
And this is why the liberals are considered by many to be blatant hypocrites. They immediately scream their outrage when a right leaning group steps over the line however when groups like  BLM (black lies murder) and Antifa starts and participates in violence all we hear are crickets. Using the left criteria that would mean the Democrats support these terrorist groups and the violence they commit.

"There are some who will say that the church can never change its position on homosexuality because the church's teaching is part of divine revelation. I say it's as much a part of divine revelation as not eating shellfish or men not cutting their hair - after all, those prohibitions, like not wearing clothes made of mixed fabrics or not eating meat with dairy products, all come from the same book of the Bible: Leviticus. And yes, St. Paul did condemn homosexual acts but he also told women to be quiet in church, and yet no one observes that rule anymore. Cherry-picking the Bible has a long history that will probably never end. But the people who mention revelation never talk about the fact that Jesus himself never said a word about homosexuality. In the end, as a gay Catholic Christian, I take great comfort in that. The church has been wrong about many things in the past. It is wrong about homosexuality, and it is time the church change its position - out of charity, if nothing else."

One of the incidents involved a boy being raped because the migrant had a ""sexual emergency"". Google it! Oh, and don't forget last New Years Eve in Cologne, Germany when over 1,900 women were sexually assaulted. The list goes on and on and the stories of the war on Western culture by Islam come out in multiples daily. Oh, but I am probably going to be labeled prejudiced or hateful against a group of people who have proven themselves to be a cancer in every society they enter.  When this comes here, you will miss those non-violent drunks. Europe is toast and Islam want to toast us too!!"

As to running for office for the 1st time at the age of 75 in 2019, I'll take your suggestion for what your suggestions are generally worth.

This isn't television, all most physical evidence can do is place someone at a scene, it doesn't determine guilt nor innocence of a criminal act. DNA is most useful in excluding suspects in a case of alleged rape, or impeaching the testimony of an alleged perpetrator who denies they were there at all.

Also, if both were impaired, then it is paternalistic and destructive to her agency to charge him with rape and not her using the ""impairment removes consent"" standard. Unless of course you buy into the Victorian notion that only men ""want sex"" and women are frail, helpless creatures who merely submit to it at best.

This is why rape investigations need to be made by actual police, not incompetent kangaroo courts driven by Title IX ""Friend letters"" explicitly saying to weight the process in favor of the accuser and remove due process protections from the accused."

One idiot ""Professional"" dog walker had no real control over his dogs and two of them had muzzles on and spent most of their time trying to get them off. When I first came into the dog area he threw his ball so that it landed right by my dog and his out of control greyhound slammed my dog.

Instead they lumped almost half the people into a group, looked down upon them and spat.

I hope she doesn't make mistakes like Obama did--going for healthcare reform instead of making sure that Dems drew the congressional districts by winning the mid-term elections.

Why is it that the people who need advocacy least have a near monopoly on it? As if elected officials needed even more motivation to advance the interests of the powerful.

"Poor Ronald Reagan was so senile he could not tell the difference between the films he had made and real life; at one point thought he fought in WWII.  The Repubs love their Ronny but he dealt the dirty Iran Contra deal, fouled the Carter prisoner exchange with Iran, mindlessly supported the Taliban as founding fathers of Afghanistan  - the list of his violent foolishness is long and depressing.

You may not have liked Obama but he was a Harvard trained lawyer who taught constitutional law in that widely respected University for some 10 years.  Obama also served as a senator and I'm not going to waste time explaining to you what is involved in organizing communities.  His foreign policy sucked in general but he did more for the US with health care than either Ronny or the fool, Trump looks as he can do.

Silly comparison."

"Tamaqua PA sex education 1962.  At the age of 5 my mother told me all about the birds and bees and sex.  In 1972 at the age of 15 my father told me if I get a girl pregnant he would break both my legs.  Simple but straight forward sex education from my parents.  And guess what I never got a girl/woman pregnant out of wedlock.  Sometimes all it takes is good parents who aren't PC.  Oh and this system of sex education worked on my son as well or at least the threat of breaking his legs did, :-)."
"O'Leary is no Trump.  I predicted Trump's win days after he announced his intention to run in the primaries.  I will predict O'Leary will end up middle of the pack if he runs for the Canadian Conservatives.  Here's why.

Religion: There is no way on earth O'Leary is going to be able to pander to the Reform Party roots within the CPC.   His religion is greed, and there are thousands of clips of him saying things to this effect.

Success:  While Trump critics decry his bankruptcies and business failures, he does still own a vast empire of hotels and has his name on many more, along with golf courses.  Trump's wealth is real.  O'Leary, on the other hand would be easily discredited as a phony ""rich guy"".  Trump wasn't stupid enough to launch a mutual fund company that has done little to make money.  Returns are numbers and the numbers aren't good.

Bombast: Trump is, funny at times.  O'Leary is just an angry, mean, vindictive, jerk.  It makes him fun to watch but there's no inspiration."

IMO, they were absolutely right to hear the Russians out.  What Trump Jr. would have done had it been useful info is strictly an assumption, and we are seeing a lot of confirmation bias here. (The Party Line Press (PLP) always construes any story to the  maximum disadvantage of the President.)

The Trump campaign might have even notified the FBI if it were incriminating info. After all, Hillary was already under investigation ( aka  Comey's whitewash).

"Q: Do facts matter?

A: Let’s find out

Fact: Obumpkin spent time, effort and taxpayer money trying to interfere/block Bibi Netenyahu’s re-election and no big deal was made of that.

Fact: Considering she has been described as the ‘smartest woman in the world’, Felony-Shrillary made another of her characteristically bad judgment calls when she brought the arrogant, stupid, know it all, John Podesta on to her team and trusted him with all sorts of access.

Fact: The DNC was arrogant and stupid not to buy the best cyber protection it could for its very sensitive files.

Fact: Both DNC and Podesta were reckless in making their materials available to any hostile foreign intelligence service that made the effort.

Fact: Whether it was Guccifer 2.0 or Russia’s GRU that passed the hacked emails to Julian Assange, no one has disputed what Podesta did in fact write.

None of my old white friends, nor did Trump, teach that young woman to drink and drive, and then run away like a coward when she plowed over someone.  
A few months ago a woman deliberately ran over a guy on a motorcycle in order to solve her problem. Killed him and then she went and ran and hid like a coward too.  Turns out she has a lengthy history of driving illegally.

"Forgive me if I don't go ballistic because Russians contacted Trump people with dirt about the Clintons, the DNC and the Democratic national campaign.

I'm old enough to remember when JFK turned over his campaign people to Lester Pearson and the Liberals in 1963 to do everything they could both fair (e.g. polling, policy research, speech and spin lines) and foul (e.g. misleading information, enlisting the general heading NATO to give a press conference lambasting the government) to defeat the Canadian Conservative government of the time.

I also remember when the Obama administration put their 2012 campaign people at Trudeau's disposal in 2015 to defeat the sovereign Conservative government of Canada.  The US polling and focus group folks were particularly useful to Trudeau and the Liberals.  (So much so the polling outfit bragged on its website about helping to defeat the Harper government before our embarrassed Liberals had this deleted.).

"I've called Mr. Trump a sociopath. Let me do it again.  IN my layman's opinion Donald J. Trump displays the actions and worldview of a sociopath. Here they are......read them, review Mr. Trump's behavior and form your own layman's opinion:  ""A sociopath can be defined as a person who has Antisocial Personality Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others, a lack of remorse or shame, manipulative behavior, unchecked egocentricity, and the ability to lie in order to achieve one's goals. Sociopaths can be dangerous at worst or simply very difficult to deal with, and it's important to know if you've found yourself with a sociopath, whether it's someone you're dating or an impossible coworker. If you want to know how to spot a sociopath, then you have to pay careful attention to what the person says or does.""  from Wikihow..... I invite any Trump defender to present the case that he doesn't evidence these characteristics. Gary Crum"

The sexual misconduct of her protégé Abedin's husband also didn't help her when that was brought back up next to her 'missing' e-mails.   

The theft and return of property from the White House didn't help.

Lying about being under sniper fire didn't help.  

Being a spokesman for NAFTA lost her votes in the Rust Belt.  

Some people were even still cranky that she was a Wal-Mart shill in Arkansas.

There were collaborationists among many of the nations invaded by Nazi Germany.

In the case of Ukraine, one must remember that Ukrainians' memories, in 1939, of the rule from Moscow included the Soviet genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33 in which millions of Ukrainians were intentionally starved to death.

Based on that experience, the Germans probably looked less dangerous than the Soviets.

Encouraging growth by holding rallies where he preens for his adoring pawns is not policy.

No, chris, your cheerleading only indicates you have no clue what growth was attained in the last administration or what specific policies account for that growth.

Trump, though not actually creating any policy yet, has been dismantling and destroying policy enacted by President Obama and just like with the health care fiasco, Trump is going to create more disasters of the same or worse proportion.

What is huge is the likelihood of your cheerleading being all for naught.  

And the people most likely to bear the brunt of Trump's disasters are old folks like you and me.

Take NB for example we have a 100% liberal MP's in NB, not a word, no strategy not a thing, meanwhile  we import Saudi Oil.

There is NO WAY - repeat, there is NO WAY - to get house prices that high without external money flooding in. It is an IMPOSSIBILITY for local wages to get house prices to 24 times, to 30 times, to 36 times the average annual local income. 

Not green space. Not mountains. Not low interest rates. Not environmentalists.

It is OVERSEAS MONEY flooding in to Vancouver that has gotten house prices so high. It is the ONLY mechanism that fits the fact pattern.

The MSM, intelligence and state departments along with the DoJ are initiating a soft coup to destroy a democratically-elected president who has committed no obvious crime.  The ""investigation"" into ""obstruction of justice"" is particularly ominous because it shows that Mueller has no regard for the law, just as federal courts have ignored the president's clear legal right to ban groups he believes are dangerous, especially when they come from countries which do not provide any information for proper vetting.  The failure to investigate felony leaks is also
a major problem.

"""Contact between a private citizen with a foreign government is different than contact between a government official and a foreign government.""

Oh really?

Cite the legal basis for that brain fart.

As for proof, we have Donald Jr. admitting that he met with  Russians who explicitly promised information that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Trump Jr.’s response? “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

And to corroborate all this Jr. released the string of emails that took place prior to the meeting.

In May we heard Trump admit he fired Comey because of the Russia thing, and them told his Russian handlers in the Oval Office that firing Comey relieved a great deal of pressure.

All we have to do is patiently wait for these nincompoops to further incriminate themselves. It's obvious to everyone except Trump sycophants like you."
"The right to free speech was enshrined in the constitution, as a right, for exactly the reason the ""dotard"" displayed this week.

Experimental my arse.  Just like Communion in the hand was experimental.
Ontario had same problem in the mid 1970's....they fixed it with speculator taxation....problem fixed overnight as a result.  Interesting back then to note the number of MPs that got caught with their pants down when the taxation came into play. Virtually everybody in Ontario that had any assets was playing the game and making easy $.  Sad that it took five years for Ontario to act given that it was an previous problem with a solution that had a proven track record for succeeding. Only the very stupid intentionally ignore history and repeat making the same mistake time after time after time.

"The trap I constantly see observers falling into is attempting to assess Trump's strategic thinking in various circumstances.  There is one possibility that often goes overlooked: He doesn't have one.  The hazards of inaccurately projecting meaning onto his behavior has three obvious dangers: 

One is that there is a tendency to cut him some critical slack when his actions are perceived as the product of deliberate & careful thought.

The second is that once meaning is projected onto his actions, then that gets ensconced as truth and used for further deeper & even more inaccurate interpretations.

Finally, the third is that it blinds analysts to the possibility that Trump's inscrutable methods are actually as idiotic as they seem at first glance."

Also well know is that the vast majority of illegals are in the U.S. working low paid jobs, not murdering and raping people...so there, get your facts straight, if Melanie did in fact abuse the terms of her tourist visa she is no better than the million of illegals that followed that very same visa scheme"

"Minimum wage went up but so did all rental prices in Salem, ensuring that people receiving the minimum wage here actually make less money than they did before the raise. My friend's was raised from $475 per month to $625 per month for seemingly no reason other than demand is now higher in Salem. He now has to move with his kids and cannot find anywhere for less than $600. His apartment complex primarily rents to illegal immigrants who have four to five people living in a unit - most of them are paid in cash well and can easily afford the apartment with so many people living there. I believe that if Salem were to STOP renting to illegals completely, the demand would level off and people who are FROM Salem can afford to LIVE in Salem. Then again, it could be due to the utter greed of Salem landlords, who love to raise the rent and then laugh about it later - I know a few, unfortunately - one is a very sick man who raises his tenant's rent when ever he feels like it (with 90 day notice)."

In 2008 the 800 billion dollars bank boo boo could have been solved by the government temporarily taking over the banks and just reselling them instead of throwing trillions at the very people that caused the mess in the first place.
Infrastructure is one of the last way that big stupid money can indenture the next generation, besides student loans and over inflating assets like real estate.

Maybe Florida does better because there is a lot more sunlight there? Alaska seems to have the most depression related events, and general feelings of not wanting to do anything during winter. Well, could poor grades be a depression and lethargy related thing?
It would be an easy theory to test. Choose one school, install UV lighting, and see if grades improve. Maybe toss in vitamin-C supplements with lunches? Wouldn't cost anywhere as much as some of the other possible solutions."

""Arab states rap Qatari reply to demands, refrain from new sanctions""

---

That would be because there were no grounds for their original demands on Qatar, let alone new sanctions.

The Saudis and their three sheep got suckered by Russian fake news plants and are now standing in front of the world looking like idiots, trying desperately to save face.

The Russians knew that the Saudis wanted Al Jazeera TV (based in Qatar) shut down because it has an embarrassing (for the Saudis) habit of exposing the brutal practices of the Saudi (and Egyptian and Bahrain and UAE) dictatorships.

So the Russians planted some fake news stories about Qatar supporting terrorism and the gormless Saudis bought it, sanctioned Qatar and demanded they shut down Al Jazeera TV.

This worked for the Russians too as Al Jazeera exposes their crimes and those of their allies Iran and Syria.

Saudi suckers.

"OMG would you please not tell lies like this?  If the law is bad, let it be bad without lying.  If you have to lie, you are not supporting a righteous cause.

This does NOT legalize child prostitution.  That is a total, absolute LIE.  Those who engage in child prostitution will be violating the law and arrested when possible.  Traffickers will be breaking the law.  This new law ONLY says that the child involved is a victim of a crime, and not themselves a criminal!!  This does not disallow police from taking these children to child protective services!!  It only means that they will not be treated like criminals, handcuffed, jailed, and saddled with a criminal record for their entire life - which would, in fact, only serve to victimize them further.    

There are other ways to deal with abused children than throwing them in jail and treating them as criminals. Do you not see this?  Why do you see these children as criminals, and not victims of a crime??  And why do you lie??"

"""...but now that Donald Trump is President the genre is essential, excoriating viewing"".
---------------------------
Just why is it essential viewing? I know Trump is an unbearable idiot so why would I need to watch a show mocking him? And to be perfectly honest, what sort of person derives their political information and opinion from a comedy show. 

In a recent article, the son of Neil Postman wrote a column suggesting his father's polemic, ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"", predicted the rise of a figure like Donald Trump. 
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-fixed-target-of-a-trump-administration-has-tv-satire-soaring/article33910624/comments/

But there is the flip side of Postman's prescient warning: those trapped in a television existence in which comedy becomes knowledge and the act of laughing at satire as protest - or worse - conceived as political action."
"Ah, the old taxation-is-a-zero-sum-game nonsense."
"Yes, and Hillary has lizard blood."
Not a damn thing. It is another lame deflection.
"Then, once Nixon's witch-hunt has been drawn to its sticky end, let's circle back and deliver a full blast of withering cosmic, social, and legal consequence for the pathological monsters who held our society in siege with their wrongful war for nearly five decades. The humanity. The loss. The harm. They must all be held to account. They must be made to pay. Adherence to cosmic justice screams aloud its demands that these Nazi-like scumbags must be made an example of that will echo forward through history and stand as a sordid reminder to posterity of what happens to false authoritarian monsters who take a knife and mutilate like psychopaths their own society for the advancement of dead ideology, political and cultural hatred and intolerance, and abject harm directed so very wrongfully against innocent decent citizens. There can be no peace without justice, there can be no justice without a full accounting and punishment delivered to the feet of these pathological subhuman monsters."
"My god. I'm floored reading this. It's so mind boggling that someone could be so ignorant of the realities kids are facing today. ""There are millions of apps for that"".

I just point out the accomplishments, or lack thereof, in his case.  I do that for Bush too, like his stupid Iraq incursion.  Sadam had nothing to do with Al Qaeda.

"Trudeau never had a connection with grass root Canadians - he's the man of the elite, the ideologues and fringe minority identity groups. Trudeau seems to have a contempt for average people and especially the working class as he happily sells them out in favour of globalist interests. He's foolish enough to believe his own biased press, that somehow the smiles, selfies and speeches will make up for incompetence and haplessness on the job. He might think: Obama was sitting on the fence for 8 years and was OK, why not me? Well, everything has changed since then..."

elevating the third world countries to be on par with the new reduced quality of life for the West.  The ultimate goal is global control by the

Unfortunately  our political ruling elite have all signed up to promote this agenda.  Most are ""useful idiots"" wanting to jump on the train

"More of that judicial activism so hated by the fascists in the hands of anyone except themselves.  This judge should be removed from any legal activity immediately.

Canada has allowed about 60 Muslims to return to Canada who have been helping Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists in the Middle East.

And Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists have called on followers of Islam to use any means to attack innocent people in western societies including Canada and al Shabaab Muslim terrorists in Somalia have called on followers of Isalm in the U.S.A. and Canada to attack people in soft targets like shopping malls.

Canadians had better be very wary and vigilant.

Who knows? Maybe some radicalized Muslim teenager will exit a prayer room in a high school in Canada and attack and kill some students and teachers. What a soft target that would be."

Getting a ringing endorsement from Trump is like getting a report that the Muppets like the way your running the country. It could also be that mafia kiss of death.

"Thimerisol was removed from pediatric vaccines in Europe, the US, Canada and most other countries (except parts of Africa and Asia) as a precautionary measure almost 20 years ago. There has never been any evidence whatsoever of adverse reactions to thimerisol in vaccines even amongst those who exhibit contact allergies. 

There is certainly no evidence of any linkage (causal or otherwise) to autism or any other serious illnesses or outcomes. You haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about. Stop spreading this nonsense."

For us, soon-to-be president Trump is a safety issue.  Trump is a racist and his alt-right soon-to-be appointees are worse.  Trump is also a real estate mogul and he'd like nothing more than to whitewash Hawaii of all its minorities and claim our remaining land for himself and his friends and as president he will have the power to enact martial law and turn the sizable military already here against us and do just that.

if they want their citizens to travel freely then just stop being idiot countries and grow up and join the rest of the world in opposing radical muslim/islam terrorism instead of supporting it.  yes i said muslim/islam because i have yet to hear of a terrorist shouting alah buddha, krishna, confucios,  or jesus christ before blowing up innocent people to make a statement.

then maybe other countries in the world - not just us - will lift travel bans on their people.  better yet, let their people rise up and say enough is enough to their tyranny.  that's how our great country was born 200 years ago."

"Hey AT, is Trump paying for the security at Trump Towers and Mar-a-Lago? Is he paying for his weekend getaways? Is He paying for AF 1 and Marine 1? BFD. His tax returns would reveal Trump is a dirty, corrupt bum. We all know that. You and all the ""we"" you claim to share a life with know it too, that takes only an IQ of about 70. Trump has loan payments to Russian Mafiosi. He owes more than he owns. If he were a Democrat, he would be in prison. Even for a troll, you aren't too bright."

"Yeah, that darned Reagan. Shameful he stopped air traffic controllers from shutting down the entire country. He was so bad that he won 49 of 50 States in 1984, with a record 525 electoral votes. 58%  of the national vote, and 60% in Colorado. Yes, truly shameful. On the bright side Mondale received 10 electoral votes in Minnesota, and 3 in D.C."

"Trump made it clear that he would not accept the results of this election IF he thought it was rigged.  Well, it was rigged.

We should not have to accept this rigged election.  This was NOT  a legitimate election - Trump is NOT  a legitimate president!"

It’s illegal though. I’ve actually been charged with this in Colorado and I told them I’m going to the news so they made up this story. They’re trying to rape and imprison me on a false accusation of beating my blind husband with my dog until it died and they’re trying to ship me across the states but it’s illegal for them to. My tax returns all say I’m single I don’t know how they get away with just imprisoning anybody for ridiculous BS.
"The Democrats pushed for this. And it is a example of why Republicans occupy Congress and the White House. For how much sales taxes have increased over the years, have we seen a measurable improvement in government? I suspect most people would say no. Also, the Democrats will lie to you and say that the sunset provision will cause it to be temporary. But then they will ask voters to approve it since you are already paying for it. I see no net improvement in the government. 

You also will see Republicans vote to just lower taxes on the rich. Their proposals always cut the high rates and leave the rates that most people pay unchanged.

We have a government that tends to be inept and stupid regardless of which political party is in power."

Stuff that would never have seen the light of day had Mark Felt, and other sources (Felt wasn't the only one leaking information) not helped to reveal it. That no-good, POS leaker, Felt was revealing information to B&W, and other press agencies, because the acting director of the FBI at the time, a fellow placed there by Nixon, was deliberately suppressing and destroying evidence to protect the Nixon administration.

"Mr. Dalton:  I""m one of those ""white liberals"" who optimistically hoped the election of President Obama signaled movement toward ""post-racial/racist"" America.""such a fool was I.""  Instead, it opened the floodgates of racism as millions of ""loyal, true, America-loving Patriots"" attacked our President with every racist/xenophobic epithet known.  He was not just a ""N#$%$#"", he was a ""N$#%$"" who wasn't even born in America.""  

We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.  

I ask myself, ""can we really elect such a man to be our President?""  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters?
Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?

I never believed a person like Trump could win the GOP nomination..I was so very wrong.
Now I can't, in my heart, believe such a man can be elected President..I hope I'm not wrong again"

Bottom line ... if we want world class universities, we need to pay competitive wages. $500,000 plus for a President is not remotely out of step with what the competition pays."

The two buffoons have succeeded and have stuck Hawaii taxpayers with a financial mess that will hit generations of taxpayers. The state will cave and extend the excise tax into perpetuity. And guess what? That still will not be enough to pay for operation and maintenance (which incredibly the city has still not released a plan of how they will pay for that), the construction of a new power plant, and the added costs of building to Ala Moana.

On guns, Trump is a disaster. He wants to reduce requirements for gun ownership and he denies that any new restrictive laws could be of benefit. He is a mouthpiece of the NRA.

On taxes, Trump is a disaster. His proposals are a road to benefit the top one percenters.

On the environment, Trump is a disaster. He is all for big coal in the midwest, a horrible pollutant.

On ethnic relations, Trump is a disaster. He advertises his policies with a loud singling out of criminals who are Hispanic or Muslim or foreigner or immigrant, while never singling out white folks.

He is the worst president of the past century based on policy. Anything diagnostic related to his brain, that's just bad icing on a bad cake."

Our entire conversation is most certainly about public opinion. It is about what we think should and should not be in our water. It is about what we think of you Fluorobots sticking your noses in our business. It is about telling you to go and peddle your poison somewhere else. 
We do not really care what you, the ADA, Delta Dental, or anyone else thinks. We care about what the citizens of our area think. There was enough support in our community to vote a resounding NO! several times.

Governments have become too far-reaching and intrusive and constituents are just tired of taking it lying down.

"Are you really that completely ignorant & stridently uninformed or did you post the ludicrous and transparently erroneous assertion that ""Trump has a 30 year history of rejecting racism and rejects racism today"" as a cheap, baseless tactic to propagate a complete misconception about who Donald Trump really is and what he actually believes? In fact, the tyrant pig Trump has a long and insidious record of both overtly racist actions, policies, public statements & controversies:

In 1973, the US Department of Justice sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations.

Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump Tower, stated that during the 1980s, ""When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor...they put us all in the back""

Aside from these factors and assuming your doctor agreed, if you wanted to keep your doctor, you could; you'd pay at out-of-network rates, but you'd get to keep your doctor."

That is our race.

We all of us seek the same things.

Why can not every other individual do that?

One only lessens themselves through their own actions, and that has NOTHING to do within their own pigment or culture, but through their own individual actions.

Bad is bad, and good is good no matter the pigment or culture.

As an individual, this is true.

But.

"All that may be true, Andrew, including ""associated being gay with being a sexual predator.""  Quite likely--because we're dealing with human beings here--some gays ARE sexual predators. No groups--and very few individuals--are left untainted.

What's missing here--because (1) it's subtle, attitudinal and often more private (2) It has been condoned by society and (3) makes men look weak and foolish, is sexual harassment and even assault perpetrated by women. 

Many women--past, present and, possibly, in the future--will continue to offer sexual favours (to husbands, mainly) as a bargaining chip, ""gimme what I want, then maybe I'll give you what you want..."" often it's implicit in years-long relationships. The ultimate ""gimme"" would be the engagement/wedding ring trade off.  Without it...no sex at all.  This behaviour can be seen to be encouraged--or aided and abetted--by a society that traditionally gave women no other real power except what they took for themselves in bedrooms."

The first issue, which came out in November, claimed the publication “stands athwart history yelling Stop.”

It proved it by lining up squarely behind Southern segregationists, saying Southern whites had the right to impose their ideas on blacks who were as yet culturally and politically inferior to them. After some conservatives objected, Mr. Buckley suggested instead that both uneducated whites and blacks should be denied the vote.""

Dotard said that ""healthcare would be easy"" (how's that ""repeal & replace"" coming along?), Dotard also said reining in the N Korean's would be easy also but after meeting with Xi Jinping said “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,”. Dotard also said that building the wall that Mexico would pay for was going to be easy. How's that wall coming along? Then just today he said ""he would not rest until Puerto Rican's are safe"" as he boarded Air Force One for yet another taxpayer paid for golf trip (24th or 25th golf trip?) to his club in New Jersey.

"Muslims from certain countries should be excluded temporarily, until the United States conduct reasonably sufficient vetting, because as a group, terrorists pose an existential threat to the United States, and almost all major acts of terrorism perpetrated throughout the world for the past 20 years have been by Muslim extremists.  The Quran is read by too many Muslims to sanction the killing of infidels, simply because they are infidels.  There you have the making of another American disaster.  Now, if the chances of terrorists' entering the country were small, or if the size of the harm they pose were small, there would be a good argument that NO special vetting is needed.  But no other population has, in recent times, had so many practitioners of both frequent and huge-scale violence.  So long as there are so many Muslims committing so many acts of terror in the name of Islam, we are rational in at least taking special care to see that those who come aren't a real risk."

 When cops kill for no valid reason and preferentially kill blacks it isn't necessarily because of Trump but it is to those they target an act of terror against them. It is an act of terror toward those communities and peoples they are supposed to protect.

"Zinke To Carve Out Exception For Home State On Shrinking Monuments

Zinke is all in with Trump's wish to sell off our public lands and parks to corporate exploitation and destruction.

Except in his home state where he's asking for more parks and more set asides of public lands.

But then again, Zinke wants to keep his home base happy so they'll support his future political endeavors.

Just another grifter and huckster."

"Are you serious? Did you even read the article? Free stuff, higher welfare, no more tolls (bridges pay for themselves). The Greens are shameless, how can they support removing tolls? Horgan's NDP is highlighted by shortsighted ignorance - pandering to NIMBYism and his bloated union base who run the NDP. Interesting how there was no word on Uber, how do you think the NDP took Surrey? Horgan made a not-so-secret deal with the taxi lobby to postpone Uber indefinitely under the guise of ""studying"" rideshare just like the Massey bridge replacement. BC deserves each other with Carol James in charge of finances - this is going to be embarrassing but the hardest lessons are usually the most expensive. 
BC's growth sectors are government unions and professional protesters (Tides/Pembina) - imagine Mayor Moonbeam's clown show in Vancouver applied to the entire province and that's what you get with Horgan's NDP."
"I was born Catholic, left for 8 years in my 20's and came back begrudgingly although Mary would have it no other way.

I teach Catechism, I prepare those preparing for Confirmation and am very active in a Catholic school for 20 years.  SO I am very Catholic, and Pope Ratzinger is my guy.  Francis has great teachings on helping the poor and servitude, but he has lost it.  He has become a Puppet for the globalist and the global warming folks.  ""WHom am I to judge a gay priest."",  Divorced Catholics who remarry can recieve Holy Communion, and all the global warming nonsense is getting ridiculous.

This goes way back to Avro Canada Ltd when it developed the Avro Jetliner (Avro C-102) and of course the Avro Arrow (CF-105). US government/ industry machinations and Canadian government foolish myopic actions killed them both. Canada still is paying the price.
"I expect as much silence on this as they had on tRump's p***y grabbing tape. The left tends to have principles on this - witness how they reacted to Weinstein vs. how the right reacts (meaning, virtual media silence) to O'LIElly, Murdoch and pResident P***grab.


Remember: tRump was caught, on tape, BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. And they still voted for him.


Anyone that watches Faux and voted for tRump is a flaming hypocrite if they only rear up on their hind legs and start bleating about Weinstein now. Remember, O'Reilly's sexual harassment was known about for more than a decade, at least for anyone not deep in denial. He's not called Falafel King for nothing."

He and Vladimir Putin, the greatest thief in history, are a matched pair.

Well, except for the thirty-IQ-point advantage that Putin has over Trump.

Otherwise....twins separated at birth.

They must have come from the same gene pool, though Trump came from the shallow end of the pool.

This is a man who right off the hop was outed for charging charities for speeches (a decent man would have donated his time) and, after a half-hearted mea culpa, Canadians ignored this indication of character and gave him a majority.  I applaud him for recognizing he's a charmer that Canada will always take back no matter how unfaithful he's been to us.  Anyway, the Ethics Commissioner is an appointment so the whole thing's a joke, he's the one who determines her fate - and Canadians and their lapdog msm think this will be a real probe.  Hilarious!"

""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" 

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children."

It's far too late now to do anything about Vancouver's ridiculously priced RE market. The damage is already done. It won't be a tech hub for long because even those workers can't afford to buy and renting is stupid expensive as well. They'll look for employment elsewhere and the Hootsuites et al will be forced to pack up and follow them to more affordable markets.

"There are many who idiotically point to Bill Clinton. 
First, do not try to excuse Trump’s bad behavior with Clinton’s behavior, that is what children do.

I was not a fan of Bill Clinton and I am not a democrat. Bill Clinton received deferments just like Trump did.
Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft in 1969. Trump was never eligible.

Trump is a draft dodging coward. 
Clinton was a draft eligible weasel.

Big difference.

Why not bring up Hillary? 
Hillary killed people so it would be okay if Trump was a rapist, right?"
Not really. It makes Brown clearly either a liar or a fool neither of which helps his quest for power.

Except for the terrorized people we have today as a result of shootings in schools, movie theaters, malls, at work, at a night club, concerts.  Selfish white boys with their selfish toys.  The 2nd amendment is deadly.  Since 911 more us men murdered their exes than soldiers have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I want the White House and Congress and State Houses and courts across the nation all open carry.  Stop hiding NRA supporters behind metal detectors or do only politicians lives matter?"
"And yet, by voting for Trump and every other Republican for whom they voted, that's exactly what they voted for. If they were too uninformed, too incurious, or just plain too lazy to read in a seemingly infinite number of places that Republicans have been trying to do that for years, then their stupidity, as usual, is their own d*mn fault. They got what they deserve. Unfortunately for the rest of us, we didn't."

"O'Leary is a serious threat because you can never over estimate the intelligence of the electorate. Voters like simple solutions even if they don't respond appropriately to the complexity of the problem. They like to be told they are paying too much tax and that unions are the problem instead of themselves. And until Conservatives abandon the politics of selfishness and greed, acknowledge the fallacy of supply-side economics and understand that government has a significant role to play in an economy, they remain totally unfit for elected office. Sadly, we have examples of buffoons like Mike Harris, Ronald Reagan, and Rob Ford who remind us that voters are either irresponsible or stupid."

They think they are going to their white mans heaven after their actions that are 180 degrees opposite of what their jesus lived and breathed. They defund, and support the defunding of programs that help the less fortunate, and give the same funds to the well monied the rich and the politicians corporate sponsors, the same kind their jesus punted out of the temples.
The evangelicals thinking and expecting to go to their white mans heaven, makes as much sense as the Mideast terrorists going to their Islamic heaven with their 72 virgins after the wholesale slaughter of so many thousands of innocents.

"Seems like everything that happens concerning vaping is embroiled in
ignorance and stupidity. These people apparently don't realize that nicotene is not a carcinogen, a fact that's been known for probably 50 years. They also apparently never read the study by the Univeristy of Maryland years ago that did some experiments with vapists and examining blood constent. Nicotene is VERY difficult to get from the  eliquid into the lungs. My experience is that it is a total waste of money to put nicotene into eliquids. I have never gotten any effect, no matter how strong a dosage of nicotene I vaped. Vaping is THE most effective means of getting smokers to quit, and if anything deserves a govt subsidy, this does. Of course, the greedy govts are collecting fortunes from taxes on tobacco. Gov Pat Brown has put a tax on ecigs , pretending that they are dangerous. In fact, the taxes are because when people switch from cigarettes they avoid the tobacco taxes. Brown is one evil, stupid SOB"

"Trump has a long list of things that came out DURING the election that would have disqualified him from office if America was a country known for having a sufficiently intelligent citizenry. What has come to light since the election--that Russia's Putin used various extra-legal measures to sway the American electorate (at least the most gullible) to not vote for soon to be former Secretary of State Clinton--is by far more serious since it has to do with a breach of national security, brought to light by America's intelligence community, that ensured a Trump victory. 
We know Trump voters to be racists and misogynists but now must add to the list the word ""traitors"" since that is truly what these Putin-Americans are--fake Americans--who have allied themselves with an foreign power that seeks to dominate the American people.

"If what you say is true, it's pretty pathetic that the millenials main understanding about the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.  And ironic that the only ones talking about the Church's teachings on sexuality are secular homosexuals and feminists in the media, not the Church.

"Meanwhile, the democrats have one rally cry ""decry anything Trump"".  While they remain blissfully ignorant that they have no message for their base, they don't know where they are as a party and have no logical candidate to put up against Trump.  The best they can hope for is that Michelle Obama decides she wants to run.  Otherwise, it's Elizabeth (#fakeindian) Warren, a rehashed 80 year old Bernie Sanders or maybe they can coax Hillbilly to run again.  It probably wouldn't take much coaxing, although her health was bad before, imagine what it will be like in 2018."

They were asking questions they KNEW the CIA and the FBI would not be able to answer.  In fact they often prefaced their 'questions' with, I know you probably wont be able to answer this but...  The goal of the repubs was to focus on leaks because they couldnt risk making themselves or their party look bad (or any worse).

"More clear evidence of white privilege.

Whites must work harder to kill whites in order to eradicate this blatant example of bias and racial inequity.

And how about Asians?  They are killed at even a lower rate than either whites or blacks.

Maybe that has something to do with fewer Asian illegitimate births, a strong inter-generational Asian family support structure, a desire to be well-educated and have a good job and stay out of trouble.  Asians are much less likely than either whites or blacks to use hard drugs and engage in criminal behavior.

White privilege is very bad indeed, but Asian privilege is even worse.

Asians must abandon their successful life strategies so that there will be more racial equity in homicides, illegitimate births, criminal convictions, lack of educational achievements, and unsuccessful lives.

It's just common sense."

"Trump is a raving lunatic. He didn't answer a single question last night with any kind of coherence.  Instead, he ranted and raved and slung insult after insult. He has ZERO diplomacy skills. Imagine if he were to have an interaction with a world leader acting like that. We'd be balls deep in World War III in no time."
"Your comment lacks truth.  No one should be groping women as Bill Clinton continues to do.  No one is allowed to attack another regardless of color, race, gender or creed.  Only the government and the Media is allowed to lie.  You may be upset that 'your' candidate did not get elected but your reaction is way over the top and foolish.  Please actually research that of which you speak first."
"""Saddened""? They slaughter hundreds of whales in the villages, but this makes you sad? GTFO"
"Do you actually want the media to ignore what the President says?  Do you also want the media to ignore criminal wrong-doing by Presidents?  Why do you find ignorant and hate-filled messages, whether in tweets or speeches, to be a media-created problem rather than something to be reported and exposed to the 'light of day'?   Would you say that the real problem with the lynching of blacks in America during the 20th century was simply the media reporting those crimes?  It appears you simply want to turn a blind-eye to repulsive, and often anti-Christian, rhetoric by politicians you support."
"Come on, you expect to registered (D)onkey voters whom voted in the dumbest politicians in the entire nation to actually think the rest of us are as gullible as they are? LOL"
The Pride festivities bring an incredible amount of money to Toronto. The very idea of cutting off the paltry funding that helps them to do so is the most idiotic suggestion I've heard in a while.
"This pathetic turd should have been on many radars. How does military justice not transfer to federal lists? In 2014 when he abused his dog, they should of been able to check him out and find him attacking his wife and cracking his kids skull. What steps did they take to help this dude, and keep him in check?"
"JT has got to be nuts, nobody in Canada needs to speak an Indian language, if the natives want to use the language let them pay for it, why would we want to support another money stream into the reserves. If they want to  learn the language of the tribe they can pay for it themselves. Canada must adopt one common language and it is not going to be French but English."
"Gimme a break! He fought against everything we stand for. He was the enemy of everything that defines our civilization. And ""we"" apologize and give him $10million. What a pathetic excuse for a country."
"You do remember that cheeto cheeks called the CIA and the other 16  intelligence agencies, Nazis just last week?  You do remember all the tweets CC put out whining about they were so unfair to him? T-rump lies and trumpsters believe. Bigly sad."
if you're truly that ignorant why shout it in public?
"Despite the CIA and FBI both concluding that Russia interfered with the US election, and despite both Republican and Democrat Senators agreeing that sanctions should be imposed based on the evidence, eighty percent of Republican supporters don't believe Russia hacked them. 
But then more than half of  the deplorables also believe that Hillary ran a pedophile sex ring out of a pizza place. 
Facts have no place in their world."
"""Thoughtful Republicans?""  What's that?  SEE the vote on Trumpcare today.  Their base will continue to vote them in, time and again, regardless of consequences.  SEE What's The Matter With Kansas?

"Did anyone see the mayor on the news last night? Now he's saying 10 years ain't enough, and he knows full well 10 years ain't enough. Tokuda and Luke WILL cave as advertised, and Hawaii will continue to blow $20 billion or more on a train to nowhere that no one will ride. Tokuda and Luke: I can understand if someone is pro rail, I can understand if someone is anti-rail. What I can't understand is why you two jag offs make like you're so against blowing more money on this wasted project, give the mayor scolding, make all big body, then give him everything he ever wanted. You two characters are so full of shibai, so full of BS you literally make me sick to my stomach."
"I don't think many killers are deterred by a maybe long sentence - that's not on their mind when they kill.  a potential sentence doesn't deter a  pre-meditated murder  - just cover your tracks, right?  if someone who has committed a bad enough crime to think that murdering their victim is the way out  probably didn't need that added umph anyway.  they are either just criminally minded, not capable of forming their own intent or ..?, a relatively low IQ..?.   there are of course exceptions, always are.   keep in mind how much is spent per prisoner.  after finding out someone close to me was a long-time serial pedophile, after reading his long-time, on-going public record of crimes - sad, these people cannot be fixed.  they are hard wired to want what they want.  it is what they want and there is no substitute.  so yeah, either physically castrate these guys, not at all  unusual for them to quit the chemical castration or - hate to say and hard to say - execute them.  it's hard to say."
"I'd love to look at a website that explains in detail all that you just mentioned. Seriously. With Trump  threatening Every God Damned Thing, we need to be educated. Can you share a link?"

"What is there to debate
Trudeau is an idiot and a dick"
He should veto such a stupid law. Russia is not our enemy and there is no proof of the alleged Russian meddling in the U. S.  Presidential election. Any measures taken to antagonize Moscow only serve the interests of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Any Western politician with an iota of common sense and concern for world peace should be doing everything in his/ her power to promote cooperation with Russia.
"none of them.  She will have a Republican House.  Unless she had a WAY better approach to working across the aisle than Obama, a vote for Clinton is a vote for gridlock

Oh and there is that ""pathological liar"" thing she has going on, plus her ""short circuiting"" to blame it on"
"I'm so glad there are stupid people like this in the world.  Two girls stupidly posted a video of themselves throwing a rabbit into the walls repeatedly and laughing.  The rabbit kept running away and they would get it and throw it again.  If they had not been stupid and posted it then they would not have gotten caught.  These stupid girls were arrested for their cruelty.  They were in their young teens.  They were from a bad home. So sad, too bad.  BTW, the rabbit only suffered a broken leg and was immediately given a good home.  The stupid girls, well people get really angry about animal abuse, so they did not fare so well."
"Waa, waa! JZ was mean to me! Try again, troll king!"
"Has there never been a high-ranking Imam,  Rabbi or Buddhist Monk charged with a crime?  Why single out the Catholic Church?  Sounds like another sorry attack on organized religion.  Apparently, you can't judge an institution by a few wrongdoers -- except in the case of the Catholic Church."

"If you were one day targetted by an ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BAN and forced to flee for your own and your family's safety, I am almost certain that you would not consider it fun.

What kind of stupid comment is that ?"
Sure. Just wait until his next early morning tweet about how Canada is robbing Americans blind on trade! I imagine JT had a good laugh once he got into private. Trump is a two-faced buffoon.
"What about the NDP female with the bottle stuck up her vagina, was that not a vulgar thing of the left?"
"Yes you are correct, the comment was crafted FOR an imbecile. Your second sentence makes me laugh out loud! Personally, I think you've got a little too much argot stuffed up your crass...."
"The selfish thing gets thrown around a lot, but guess what? Everyone is selfish. Basically every choice is selfish. Ask any parent why they had kids and it will start with ""I want/wanted."" 

Besides which, having kids is certainly not the only way to contribute. We all pay taxes. And guess who is paying for your kids to go to public school, while never having kids of their own use them? Yup, us. 

Guess who is funding your playgrounds and parks? Yup, we're putting money in on that too. 

It isn't all about being so obsessed with getting something out of the world. There are plenty of us who look at the tax breaks parents are entitled to and get pretty pissed off when we don't get nearly as much back compared to what we pay in. We're often subsidizing YOUR choices---not the other way around. 

Not to mention the fact that there are MANY reason why someone might opt not to have kids. Better to not have kids than to be a shitty parent. No one made you the life police. Get over it."
"ISIS has killed far more Muslims than Christians.

Not that makes things better but ISIS did not kill Muslims for being Muslims. They do kill Christians just for being Christians.

In ISIS' words: Christians are their ""favorite prey""."
"Victoria Leon Guerrero is a stupid white girl who pretends to be a native Chamorro.  She also pretends to hold a PHD, when, in reality, she has a terminal masters degree and will never have a PHD.  Stop playing Dr. Chamorro and go back to being stupid white girl."
"Thanks Tony: you nailed it. The bottom line in all of these crazy policies, is the make up of Board of Game. (BOG). No board that had any balance on it would allow hunters and trappers to bait Denali's iconic wildlife out of the park and kill them. Unfortunately for all Alaskans The BOG doesn't care about the opinions of any one that isn't a hunter or trapper. Contrary to the constitution there's not evan a token member to represent the large majority of Alaskans who don't hunt or trap. Most Alaskans aren't against hunting but neither do they want what we now have, citizens who want to see wildlife that's alive (which is the majority) being completely shut out."
The story about the awful alt-reich Evangelical Protestant preacher wannabes harassing the Latino congregation is awful.  Trumpkins tend to be bullies.
And you're voting for the pathological liar then.....
"Terrorists kill to support their jihad.  Thrill seeking killers thrive on publicity.  This guy was a terrorist killer with a specific target and a religious/political objective.  The photo could motivate thrill seeking copy cats perhaps.  Yes, publicizing the faces of killers is something to think deeply about.  But look at all the crime stories, it is the normal routine to put mug shots with the stories.  Basically, we are on a train speeding down the tracks with little thinking about possible alternative paths trapped by the rails."
"More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country."
"A society that embraces abortion rights makes their women cheap, accessible, and exchangeable to wicked men."
"I'm sure he will continue to fool the MAGAphants.  As trump lapdogs, they will watch Fox News and be bombarded with Koch Brother ads and be convinced their lives are better with each giveaway to the the 1%.  One wants to laugh at their idiocy, but it's not funny when the Clown-in-chief and his lapdogs implement their self-serving economic policies."
"...he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,' according to a statement an FBI spokesman provided to the Journal... 'Once the campaign was over, officials said, Mr. McCabe and FBI officials felt the potential conflict-of-interest issues ended,' the Journal reported.""

So, Trump was ""inaccurate"" in that he rounded up from just over $675k, didn't distinguish between McAuliffe's PAC an the Va Dem Party PAC controlled by McAuliffe, and didn't make clear that McCabe wasn't solely in charge of the Clinton investigation. But, that's the thing about tweets -- the idiot character limit means it's hard to make distinctions, so that reading tweets make you stupider. However, this is what Trump wrote when in a less restricted format: ""It was just learned that one of the closest people to Hillary Clinton, with longstanding ties to her husband and herself, gave more... than $675,000 to the campaign... (cont'd)"
"What is the basis for FGM? Extreme misogyny, jealousy of women's ability to grow life, hatred of women's sexuality. I cannot fathom the reasons for this kind of torture and mutilation! Perhaps if the head of a man's penis also had to be removed at the same time a woman's clitoris was removed this butchery would come to a quick end!"
The part-time HNL mayor is only interested in enriching himself and maintaining some vestige of power to keep himself relevant. Narcissist in the truest sense.
"Radical Muslims  want to kill infidels and destroy the west, Moderate Muslims want  them to, so there's nothing to speak up about."
"This report repeats an error/falsehood the pathetic media continues to make. Boyle did NOT say the Haqqanis killed his daughter. He said they ""authorized the murder"" of his daughter. Whatever that may mean, it is not the same thing.  The MSM are physically incapable of conveying the truth."
"Many of the homeless and the transients on the mall fit into your ""bully and harass"" classification. They frequently are ""jerks"" to people who are using the mall for their business or enjoyment. Does this bother you at all?"
"What a pile of crap and a great big red herring.  Taxing the rich more isn’t going to fix any of these so called problems.  They could take the whole $33 Billion away from the two richest Canadians and it will barely cover one year of Trudeau’s out of control deficits so taxing them a little more would only be a drop in the bucket.  There’s only so many billionaires to shake down, then what would he do?"
"Thank you for trying as hard as you could to deal with the recalcitrant GOP super majority Senator Gardner.

"John Kerry.  You sir are an idiot!!  How in the hell did you become Secretary of State, and how in the hell did you become a US Senator.  Did your brief stint in Vietnam cause some kind of mental problem, or were you just always like that and nobody caught it?    North Korea is a ""man made (looming) disaster"".  Climate Change is a ""natural phenomina"" that needs no catalyst, but may well deserve some degree of human intervention to mitigate the effects - addressing the result vs. the cause.  You serve no cause, other than your own or AlGore, to make these ridiculously stupid statements."
He has a submarine? Damn 😎
"Why? Because Trudeau doesn't give a damn about real Canadians. He's more interested in his global image.

He's a poseur of the worst kind.  This is one of the reasons he'll be turfed out in 2019."

Maybe you people should have thought this through before you decided and committed to collude with deplorable oligarchs, criminals, psychopaths, fascists and neo-Nazis, and mil-spec PsyOps operators like Mercer's Cambridge Analytica in a conspiracy to brainwash and mislead like pied pipers so many child-like men in this brazen attack upon and subversion of our liberal democracy.

"a_r:  Don't be so foolish.  With a sales tax EVERYONE, resident and non-resident alike, will pay something, however ""minimal"", to support the state services they utilize.  Non-resident workers would pay a minuscule amount of income tax as most are seasonal and do not earn enough to pay an income tax.  Apparently you would like to give all the tourists, visitors etc a free ride.  I think they should contribute revenue to offset expense. Besides that what is wrong with residents paying something for state services and benefits?  Afterall you are happy for 50% of Alaskan wage earners to pay an income tax for those state services that benefit everyone, right?  Estimates are that a sales tax would generate twice the revenue of an income tax, but you know that too."

"There is no such thing as your ""ACORN/Soros"" connection. I don't understand what you're getting at with your link, but I gues you weren't aware that there isn't a single mention of George Soros in the entire article. Soros does not fund Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter isn't an organization and you can't give money to it.

As for the ACORN nonsense, if you would read the link you posted, you would have understood that the ""voter registration fraud"" was actually workers defrauding ACORN. None of the bad registrations resulted in anyone voting. ACORN actually flagged the bad ones for the various clerks. That's because the law REQUIRES anyone who conducts a voter registration drive to turn in EVERY card they gather. It would have been illegal for ACORN to discard the ones they thought were bad. 

ACORN was the victim of fraud, not the perpetrator. Please read more on this and you will understand it."
"DIVIDE AND CONQUER - It seems so far Trump has divided the UK from his detractors. By and large. It seems Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (where I understand he has business ties) are excluded and divided from their fellow Moslem countries), AND NOW IT SEEMS you are suggesting Canada has been (or is being) divided from the civilized world. Russia has been openly embraced, and the move is on to ditch Ukraine and Georgia, and the removal of sanctions seems to be on the agenda. Your run for cover is disgusting to me - it is appeasement - it didn't work with that other racist liar which cost the world so much in the 1940s. Why do you think this should be our national policy now?"
"Stop blowing the heads off unarmed persons.  That there are no repercussions from some pretty egregious police actions is beyond disturbing.  In fact, it is a tacit action telling civilians that rights are optional if it at all inconveniences the police.  Listen the Mark Fuhrman tapes.  ""It was a good thing we had navy blue uniforms.  That way the blood didn't show and you couldn't tell if our uniforms were wet after we washed the blood out that got all over us when we beat some stupid n****.""   And there's 19 more hours of tape detailing how they planted weapons, drugs, etc.  Or there is Capt John Burge caught bragging how he tortured confessions out of over 200 black suspects.  I have utter contempt for any profession that demands, not asks, but demands respect while so pathetically blind to the criminals in their own midst."

"Lars, at least be truthful, & declare up front that you suffer from Putrumpski Undeniabley Stupid Syndrome & YUGE Simpletons disorder (PUSSYS). PUSSYS is a pattern of pathologically dissociative & psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, & increasing in severity with passing time. Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled with inexplicable feelings of euphoria, feeling sorry for themselves & uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Donald Trump is a pathological liar who was put in office by Putin, not the American people, & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached.  Research is ongoing but PUSSYS appears to be prevalent in primarily conservative, profoundly ignorant, NRA Heavy, excessively religious red state populations."

"Let's see . . . There are roughly 4 million children born in the Union every year which would populate the target demographic mentioned in the article, children under 4 years of age, at approximately 16 million.  Out of those 16 million children, approximately 50 have injured or killed thems loves or others with an unsecured, loaded firearm.  Why, that's the very definition of a national epidemic, less than 1/1000th of 1%, isn't it?

Is every such instance a personal tragedy?  Absolutely, without question.  However, that's not the thrust of the op/ed piece presented here.  The thrust of the agenda laced article masquerading as news is that more government intervention is needed in the lives of 99.999% of children under 4 years of age, their families and all of the families without a single person in the subject demographic as a result of the national epidemic on our hands.  Ridiculous on its face doesn't even begin to describe such nonsense."

Once free this man came to Canada months after being freed and during our election slammed Harper and campaigned for the Liberals.

This is the beginning of the code.
18 U.S. Code § 227 - Wrongfully influencing a private entity’s employment decisions by a Member of Congress or an officer or employee of the legislative or executive branch

Assuming you understand, the federal government can legally take away benefits from state governments. They are not private entities. What the governmnet can not do is threaten to take away, in this case, a tax exempt status for not following a hiring and firing mandate.

It is good for Trump that he is ignorant and not smart. He is not in violation of the code because the tax exempt status does not exist.

"I see.  So the emboldened white supremacists, the Russian bots and tRump amping it up in his rallies and advocating jail for a political appointment and the probability that this vile man inhabiting the WH courtesy of Russia has nothing to do with it?  The fact that tRump even said he could get away with murdering someone on the street, his incessant lying, his misogyny, his combativeness, his probably collusion with Russia, his clear racism that has been evident for many years, his dismantling of protections we have fought for and anything that is for the people and takes care of our own in order to build a wall and wall us in and his saber rattling with North Korea, his climate change denials etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc are not AT ALL responsible for the reaction from not just the left, but the middle and moderate Republicans too.  Nothing at all, huh?  And it is so so tiresome to you that people are livid about this dangerous person?  Awwww poor you.  Pity party anyone?"
"This is b.s. She should do her research before shooting her mouth off. There are videos of Trump acting the same way while talking about other people who are not disabled. Also, you can see video of this reporter talking and he does not wave his hands like that. So Trump was not mocking his disability, his issue was with what the reporter SAID. But the media puts something like this out there and a whole lot of stupid people just buy it. Kind of scary, actually. And who cares what Meryl Streep says, anyway?"

While not every single solitary Muslim wants to create a shadow legal and social system in western countries, many do.  There are documented cases of this occurring in the US, UK, and Canada.  

There are many Muslims who practice things that we consider abhorrent in North America - like making women second class citizens and throwing gays off buildings.

Rate cut? it's like amortizing a mortgage from 25 years to 35 years.., we only pay more interests over a longer period. Our debts will be carried over from our children to grandchildren. And why the Ontario alternative energy is being built by a French company? hence, profit goes to oversea foreign corporation.
By selling off assets they have hamstrung all future governments and revenue streams to taxation. And the federal governments is looking at doing the same with Airports and other federal properties. Liberals are bankrupt when it comes to ideas and consistently leave future generations to clean up their mess. The Ontario taxpayer is truly screwed for generations, and they have foisted the same idiotic thinking nationwide! Oh Canada, I weep for thee!"

That must have been a sight, Israelis and Muslims dancing around the smoldering ashes of the Twin Towers! A sight indeed, Jews and Arabs getting together over a disaster!

Have you heard of Occam's razor? It says the simplest explanation for an event is usually the true one. The 9/11 attacks were certainly a conspiracy, carried out by mostly Saudi citizens, planned by the Saudi Osama bin Laden.

So - invariably you're going to have just one company doing it. Even if you split the task among companies - they aren't competing. The sewage company isn't in competition with the damn company. It's going to be a monopoly. So the company has no incentive to be any more efficient, cheap or provide better service than government was.

The whining reporters from the PC brigade are mad because , with their declining influence in shaping public opinion, nobody listens to their rantings any more. Every single mainstream outlet piles on their biased outrage whenever they get the chance.
Trump told the truth at his conference, that there was fault on both sides, and he's been the only one in hundreds of years to have the nerve to do it... there's some really bad dudes on the left!

I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?

After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible, evil man."

"Stephen Miller's attack on reporters set a combative tone for what otherwise could have been the start of a good debate on a new immigration policy. The American immigration system is long overdue for modernization.  A points based system like Canada's has been proposed. This is a good start provided the points are not skewed to effectively discriminate. Canada's system, while not perfect, does try to strike a balance. You get points if you speak an official language, have skills in an underserved labour segment, have family or others who will sponsor you, etc. All good things to help you be successful as a new Canadian. 

The current American ""lottery"" approach, while fair, does not serve America or immigrants well.

"The duty and purpose of any Govt is to look after the interests of their own country.     How this is done is the real debate.

Eg:  Some would argue that Butt's should distance himself from Bannon (a racist clown) - but given that Butts and Bannon are meant to be behind the scenes - would that have better served Canada's interests?    They're both doing their jobs by ""getting along"".    Politics is a dirty job.

Same deal with Trudeau and Trump.    But Trump has clearly not acted in his country's best interests.   In 8 months he has pandered to JUST his core  support and has reduced the U.S. President's stature to that of an international joke as well as increased divisions in his own country (and party).      Trudeau campaigned on the left but has governed more ""right"" which is how Liberals usually govern.   But arguably - that is what they SHOULD do, since they are governing for the entire country, not just their supporters.   No govt should pander to JUST their own supporters."

"I understand your position, but let me bring a counterpoint. ""Someone may be uncomfortable"" is not really the best comparison. The simple threat of bathroom bills like this have resulted in more than 20 women being assaulted for being allegedly ""transgender"" across the country. Transgender people have faced actual bodily harm and death at a far higher rate than average society. This isn't simply ""feeling uncomfortable"" it's actually a matter of personal safety.

As for non-transgender people being uncomfortable: Why are we so worried about what other people are doing in the bathroom if it doesn't directly affect us?

Moreover, your implied critiques of Trudeau for fostering bilateral relationships, working with the UN and making a point of standing up for the LGBTQ community say more about your appetite for intolerance than anything else. 

Your partisan bile can't hide the fact that whatever disputes you might have with the Liberal government's policy orientation, or your personal animus towards its leader, the fact is that decent Canadians would be loathe to leave their women folk alone in Trump's company; and, decent Canadian trades and service people would think twice before working for Trump for fear of either being stiffed or subject to discriminatory treatment.

Let me see if you will acknowledge this statement: it is not the STATUS of the collective influx of foreigners that is the problem, it is mainly the NUMBERS of foreigners flooding the borders of many Western nations which is the main problem at hand."

David Duke.  

David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard, is unambiguous about what Saturday’s alt-right and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, means to him: It’s the fulfillment of President Donald Trump’s vision for America. “We are determined to take our country back,” Duke said from the rally, calling it a “turning point.” “We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back.""  

It's no big secret that a solid part of Trump' base of support encompasses the ault-right, the white supremacists and the white nationalists.  It's silly to attempt to deny this relationship...it's right there in front of you.  Gary Crum"

Every previous negotiation was bad and Americans were outsmarted by others according to Donald.

They constantly break everything from tax laws to sexual harassment laws. They have been  convicted of large  scale fraud, deceptive business practices and false advertising over and over.

Instead they allowed the trail grow cold, and only brought in one cadaver dog, 9 days after Jacob went missing, for ONE HOUR.

They should have requested that the Coast Guard have a helicopter do a fly-over (I called the coast Guard myself and had them call the Park Rangers), and instead... when the Coast Guard called the Air Force (who has jurisdiction over National Parks and must subcontract the search to them)...who called the Park Rangers to ask if they would like to request a fly-over, the rangers said it wasn't necessary.

"Sex is often used by a low status woman to gain access to resources that she otherwise cannot gain. Women use sex not only for financial gains but to advance her careers, to develop her intellect, to enrich her experience. That is often why title IX in university campus makes sense (although some denounce it as a kangaroo court) because we do not want to make a university campus a cesspool dripping with genital fluid where nubile students are blowing their professors during office hours for fucking reference letters for graduate school. This is an insult to cleaning staffs. However, historically female students have been dating their professors and gained a helping hand in career promotion. This pattern of trade between female sex and male resource is common in other industries (especially in arts) where nurturing is required by people high in dominance hierarchy. 

The bad part is much of deal making is left in the dark and stuff of rumours, cryptic messages in the bathroom."
"This case will end up being about religious freedom, but I think it goes beyond that.  As I stated earlier, I am neither religious nor against same-sex marriage.  I see this case as a freedom of speech issue that goes beyond religious concerns or discrimination.  What I am concerned about is that we might get into a situation where a baker is required to make a personal work of art in support of a race-related, sexual orientation-related, or religion-related event.  Will he be required to make a cake for all religious events if he makes them for Christian holidays?  Will he be required to make a cake for race-related organizations, potentially putting him into a political situation? (ex:  Black Lives Matter or White Nation groups/events/rallies/etc.)
The baker clearly stated that he would serve anyone the same thing.  He will create a cake for a heterosexual wedding for any customer -- straight or gay.  What he will not do is create a cake for a same-sex wedding, regardless of customer"

"I remember them saying that.  Curious what those messages said?  Too bad they didn't report it.  Might've tripped up the idiot's plans.

Even if the AF reported it, with the number of guns and the lax laws that control private sale, it's likely the nutbag would've gotten them anyway."
"Ah yes, it will be just so interesting to see what kind of ""style"" emerges in Washington when a lying, authoritarian, racist, bigoted, xenophobic, misogynistic sexual predator gets elected to the White House. Yes, his ""style"" will be fascinating, for sure."
"Tell me what will it take to get them off their knees and start standing for the anthem? If they felt by pissing off a large number of NFL supporters by disrespecting the flag was a good way to get people to join and support their protest, than they were just flat out stupid."
"That's beside the point. Americans will ignore and belittle OWS! because of its optics, the way it looked--which was sordid and a little ridiculous--but the OWS critique of the high levels of inequality in the USA. and of the culpability of both parties, was solid, and remains so. 

Very little has happened to change this because to change it would be to challenge the power of wealth in an unbearably direct way."
"Then vote to censure him. Wringing your hands to the media is one thing - still supporting any of his agenda means you still are with the Nazi sympathizer in the WH. 


Better yet: start the removal process most likely to get this racist incompetent game show host out of office. 


The sooner the country puts this idiot behind us, the better."
"How the hell does Amy Demboski have a radio show? 

How does that shrill idiot not recognize her hypocrisy?

Are there really enough mouth breathers buying products from advertisers to keep this moron on the air?
i just don't see enough pick-ups flying Confederate flags to warrant her existence. apparently they're like cockroaches, for every one you see there are 1000 you can't see."
"Not everyone got screwed. If you're a government union employee you just got screwed! LOL 
(D)etroit baby, here we come, FULL SPEED ahead, chooooo chooooo!"
"Is this a joke?

The elites have had the last 25 years to do something, anything. All they've done is nothing.

Oh no, I'm wrong. What they've done is rigged the system to give all the benefits to themselves, and toss off a few crumbs every now and then to us peasants.

To hell with the elites."
There is absolutely no need to explain or defend against his hate speech. Wasilla should be ashamed of itself for electing this knuckledragging moron.
"Any destruction of Alaska's Grand Nature by the oil n gas industry means the industry needs higher standards.  The state needs to be the state (tax, regulate, oversight) and quit trying to be a partner.  Public/private partnerships are stupid.  Good read!"
"Justin is nothing more than than an eco bully. So much for his famous listening. Now he can go tell all his celeb friends how effective he is, what a moron."
Anglican priests left because they hated the gay bishop they had and didn't care about women being treated with justice in church either.
I can't believe someone actually wrote this comment.  Unbelievably naive and more or less ridiculous.
"Hawaii, this joke is on us!!!!  This is nothing but a big joke and the obvious stupidity of the decision made by a Harvard educated federal judge pales on the failure of a renowned educational institution to produce top-of-the-line lawyers.  How did he get his JD, maybe because he is ethnically a ""minority?""  I ponder the decision and the very meat of it and cannot grasp how such an erroneous decision could be conceived.  The law is the law, the Constitution is the Constitution, why is there so much latitude that a decision of this nature could be made?  This is so crazy, and ill-devised that it is shameful for all of Hawaii.  The FJ is in the ""I am above the law"" zone and needs to be taken down a notch because his bad attitude clearly shows.  POTUS should just say you're fired or just ignore the decision and override the it.  End of  story!!!"
"Larry, you should be taking the same drugs that Trump should be taking."
"Trump  wants to kill America.
He is Putin's poodle. The ultimate Manchurian candidate."
Well at least Furries aren't anywhere near as repugnant as juggalos. To bad WW couldn't dedicate an issue to Furries. Guess they don't have enough $$$.

"It is until reality hits and they're sued for refusing entry to a legit student from OSU or PSU. These guys are fools to impose restrictions on everyone but Oregon students. My UO student daughter and I will be sure to avoid any business affiliated with the owners and that includes Oregon Taxi, who hire the most dangerous rookie drivers in town."
"<The upside of renting is having more money to travel>

... until you run out of money, idiot."
"And if an employee cannot live on the offered wage, he/she should get another job. If such employee fails to command a higher wage for the work provided, clearly we're talking about a deficient and failed employee."
"Good grief. I addressed Tim Mueller’s comment, asking the question, “How do you know they are worse off?” For the sake of discussion I’ll accept your unsubstantiated claim that most panhandlers are homeless. Even then, how do you know they are worse off? Are we going to have an answer based in fact?

That out of the way, I’ll question your unsubstantiated claim. Again, your feelings do not equal truth.

As for the defintion of a troll, you’ve posted it many times to uncivilly cast aspersions on others without realizing that it is perhaps you who is the troll. And your response to me, implying that I am a troll (when I wasn't talking to you in the first place), only proves true my comment which you call an “ad hominem attack.”"
"PROGRESSIVE CANINE COCK HOLSTER MOUTHS

We cannot even trade beer freely across provincial boundaries and these fools talk about pot.
"What's troubling is that the gay couple did this on purpose, they knew very well that the baker will not agree to do the cake and they were just looking for trouble, having nothing better to do. What happened to our country's live and let live tolerance which includes all? They could go to any other bakery, but picked this one to force a lawsuit. Talk about a fascist way of doing it, this is it."
"That man has big balls!  Trudeau, not so much."
"The MSM has no problem calling the President mysogynist, racist, homophobic. But when it comes to Eminem, the NYT can only come up with ""some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses"". What a double standard! Eminem produced millions of records that prove it and only ""some"" accuse him??"
"Yes, an officer that violates federal law without a warrant is scum.  But that isn't very nice language.  Criminal will suffice."
"Those kids aren't wearing helmets!

Look at the crap dangling from the undercarriage. Maybe this wasn't the first time.
What a vision. Mother down there rigging up for a good time with the young'ns.
Who wants to go for a ride with Mommy?"
"Well, at last they had to go back to 2013 to find a picture of him looking like a little, sissy school girl. And while wearing a cowboy hat no less. Are those the gloves of a cowboy?  

I'm sure that if he had been wearing nice leather riding gloves, we would have never seen the picture."
"The  DP  loves  these  types,like  they  love  muslim  terrorists  and  other  killers."
"Trudeau is too stupid to know any better than to legalize another drug but Blair, a former cop, should.  The moral race to the bottom.  What do the medical doctors across the country think about addicting 18 and 19 year old youth ?"
they should be horsewhipped.
"What does Canada care? They have an fool for a leader and the people are seemingly happy to allow their country to be overwhelmed with immigration.

Criticising the UK for at least attempting to take control of its own affairs just sounds pathetic."
Elimination of criminals is a public service.  Of course some folks are too stupid to understand the truth of that statement.
"Now, here is a guy who seems to be a soul mate of Trump!!!
Except C. Pell grab boys by their genitals instead Trump grab girls by their genitals!

Is this a sign of human society's progress of 21st century, or is it 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing? 
Are Vatican boys doing 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing & insist on this UNCHANGING slavish attachment to sex organs in ordaining priest only if one has boy's sex organs? 

I am afraid people will beginning to see boy's sex organ when we see men in clergy outfit!!!    
LOL, ROFL, LOLOLOLOLOLOL in tears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Yes the citizens indeed elected this idiot. Not Vancouver's finest moment.
"More hockey porn for you Leaf lovers. Have at it, boys!

"hey boy, talk big, you say there is corruption, then prove it.  enough of this stupid nonsense, you sound like a 5 year old.  you don't like it, then move, nobody is holding you back.  just get the hell out of here, you really don't belong here, no rednecks."
"For the very same reason that they endorsed Harper, of course.

Even to the point of the absolute ridiculous :

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/the-tories-deserve-another-mandate-stephen-harper-doesnt/article26842506/

The stupid, squeaky wheel now gets the grease and drives media revenues. 

Hopefully, a strategy like this still backfires in Canada."
Has someone hacked or taken the name Diane Marie?  Where once this person comments has some degree of intelligence lately they have all been dimwitted in their deflection of Harper did it or it's all Harper's fault that Trudeau does what he does.
"klastri>  Everything with you is psycho this, psycho that, you must be the psycho.  Since you are so wound up with the word.  What you say about Trump is fake news which you continue to spew just like vomit."
"Damn straight!!  The drug companies made massive profits peddling their product, telling their customers that it wasn't addictive, when they knew full well that it was.  Alaska should jump onboard a nationwide class-action lawsuit.

There's more than enough blame to go around, but it all begins with the drug companies and they should be held to account."
"Never underestimate the idiocy of the Hawaii Democratic Party.
This photo op with Muslim community leaders? Are you kidding me? Like anyone here really cares about Muslims or their values here in Hawaii, other than a handful of liberal Democratic do-gooders who kowtow to their D.C. counterparts every chance they get. 
Our attorney general was appointed to serve our state, not federal and international interests. If he loves Muslims so much, he should be airlifted along with the rest of the protesters to Syria or Iraq, and dropped right into the battle zone. They'll find out quickly that love is not reciprocal."
lol suckers
"Look at south end of Forks, a real garbage dump, with criminal illegals living there, right next to visitors center! How nice! Welcome to Forks and the garbage Dump trailer park that looks beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"As silly as this example is, it is a perfect illustration of a simple premise.  Businesses and consumers should be free to transact without any interference from governments or legislators.  Freedom is key and it always has been.  Government intervention like this leads to dead weight loss and it is ultimately responsible for people starving.  The only role of government should be to protect basic human rights, own/manage shared resources/infrastructure and redistribute income to individuals (not businesses) that are in need, so long as motivation to get off that assistance remains."
"A general entry for the CIA in Wikipedia.......geez.

Now you've passed Weak and are approaching Pathetic."
"If OJ were white, he'd be on death row, where he belongs."
That's just plain stupid.
"If you take the original  meaning of ""dumb"", you'll agree that Trump is quite the opposite.  Let's just stick to ""foolish""."
"probably planted by a weeping Hillary lover, in an attempt to show one last time just how evil white people are. All you people yakking about this crap are swamp rats. America told you what we thought of you, now go. No? Didn't think you would, those fat, fat paychecks from the taxpayers are soo addicting. You vermin are all going to have to be drug out of your rat holes one by one. Fine with me. To your pitchforks, men!"
The evidence is the video of Trump doing it. Willful ignorance is not a defense.
Now which is more ridiculous? The Trump camp's quest to find Obama's birth certificate and his place of birth? Or the left's quest to find Russian collusion? Most people would probably say that the former is insaner than the latter.
"How in the world can you have eight years of Theology and then claim the views that you profess?  I have four years of advanced study in math, (Calculus I, II, III &IV /Matrix Algebra/Differential Equations)  and science(Biology, Physics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Statics & Dynamics) and a BS degree in Chemistry.     I know the sciences just as well as you proclaim, and mine ended with an actual degree in same.  So what, big deal it means nothing. I have  faith, which you claim to be anathema. You are clearly in a state of apostasy."
I see you're still eating the elephant dung. Do us all a favor and cut YOUR wage to minimum and tell us how it works out.
"Self important too, huh?  I am having fun with you.  Intensely personal - you think my comment was intensely personal?  Really?  Saying that I am a patriot and prefer intelligent, productive, constructive conversations and even disagreements is intensely personal?  Claiming I am a patriot who loves country first is intensely personal?  And you have a self inflated view of your impacts.  If anything, your impacts are to draw real Americans together against your hateful, mean spirited rants and your stupid come backs that you think are clever."
"jeezus Lesia, it's 5 mins to 1! don't you have work tomorrow? or did you quit to troll online full-time?

as for my opinions, those are based on things i see, read and hear. you are the one presenting your view of the situation as fact. 

oh and the ""two possibilites"" that you've allowed me aren't really the only ones, are they?

anyhoo, i'm beat and going to sleep. i don't see much reason to continue our dialogue. i'll just look out for you in the future, and will happily joke around at your expense.

cheerio, and good morning to you i guess.. thought you were local.

p.s. i wouldn't call you a ukrainian fascist in a skirt, but that doesn't mean you ain't one ;)"
Puny person.
"Good lord it looks like mr. zipper plat is being duped by alt-right fake news just as the so called president is. It's a plague of ignorance and even the POTUS is immune to the affliction. Anything that reinforces that latent need to hate, fear and look down on some other group is swallowed whole and never ever questioned. What next?"
"Don't be fooled people, Boston is one of the most bigoted cities in the US."
"Yes but we are talking about a man who praised a brutal dictator on the international stage, the fool still thinks we live in the 70s!!!

His credibility is free falling."
"Dershowitz is a scumbag who vocally supported torture under the Bush regime.  His ""ethics"" are whatever suits his whims from time to time.  He is a perfect acolyte of the Blue Church.  A really bad man."
"Hannity is a trump clone if it's not good trump it's no trump on his show after all people who what Fox beleive in big foot,ufo,swamp monsters and all that made up tv crap."
"I was just telling them who Harburg was, as should have been evident even to you.

But I suppose you could not pass up an opportunity to make an inane, irrelevant sneer. You, who preach that others should be humble and Christlike, seem to think that nastiness for its own sake is good."
Lifeguards are useless.
Well the Dumper Post has a Indian idiot writing with this guy!
